1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,960
whenever a young 21-year-old boy or girl

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,440

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,679
Founders people like yourself successful

4
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,400
they get generic we don't want to know

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,839
what you've said already so intent here

6
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,480
was to ask you non-usual

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,289
[Music]

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
questions

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,239

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,280
guys for coming pleasure the very first

12
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,239
thing we do when we call people is we

13
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,199
try to get to know them in a manner that

14
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,640
even they haven't spoken online or it's

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,440
not available so we don't want to know

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,000
any of the stuff you're all popular

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,399
people you've done

18
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,800
interviews uh we don't want to know what

19
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,040
You' have said already so we'll try and

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,960
nudge it in a direction uh which will

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,119
help us learn a bit more about you and

22
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,200
uh for the point of this

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,320
show uh there's no drama there's no like

24
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,600
uh you know trying to get a reaction out

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,079
of anyone it's very much focused on a

26
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:28,439
20-year-old boy or girl and when they

27
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,640
are starting off

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,159
uh what can they learn from the

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,280
learnings you've had without any filters

30
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,119
uh we did a venture capital episode and

31
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:41,159
we came to the conclusion that 90 95% of

32
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,680
startups fail you three have succeeded

33
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,360
and you must have done something

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,040
differently and today is about finding

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
out what that could be and how other

36
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,719
people can learn from it so maybe we can

37
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,680
start with kzle tell us about your life

38
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,640
from the very beginning

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,880
from childhood all of that and take as

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
much time and what others don't know yet

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
yes what others don't know I I think

42
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,919
others don't know a lot about um how

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,720
confused and how um I would say I was

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,319
still figuring it out for the longest

45
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,000
period of time until eventually of

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,480
course people started believing that

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,840
this is the definition of success and

48
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,519
that's for others right um so I come

49
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:28,879
from a humble middle class family I was

50
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,920
born and brought up in chandigar uh up

51
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,680
till my marriage chandigar was the only

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,840
place that I had stayed in because the

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,800
background that my parents come from or

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,120
I have come from uh they're not they

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,360
were not very Pro sending women out for

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,840
jobs or working so that's that's the uh

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,480
you know the childhood that I've

58
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,400
experienced I was probably the first

59
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,920
women in my family to go out and work uh

60
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,120
but the only difference between the rest

61
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,400
of my family and my parents was um the

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,560
conviction that both my parents had to

63
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,080
ensure that our kids are going to be

64
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,560
independent in life was this in

65
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,159
chandigar in chandigar itself so like I

66
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,200
said up till my marriage chandigar was

67
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,239
my geographical a very pretty geography

68
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
beautiful it's called the city beautiful

69
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,840
right I love that place I think till

70
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,480
today that's my favorite City uh but

71
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,040
while I was growing up that wasn't the

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,920
case because I I saw potential outside

73
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,480
the city but was not sort of allowed to

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,760
explore it I was told that within this 5

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,720
kilomet of radius whatever you want to

76
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,319
do feel free to do it feel free to pick

77
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,239
it up um so that's how my um you know

78
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:45,920
what did your parents do so my father um

79
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,599
continues to be a businessman um very

80
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,560
interesting story I think first lessons

81
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,439
in entrepreneurship is um I learned from

82
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,519
him when I was in standard 8th um so big

83
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,079
joint family uh my father is three

84
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:02,439
brothers and Five Sisters so eight kids

85
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,680
in total uh grew up with a lot of love

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,079
um but eventually realized that a

87
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,319
business that was being run by Brothers

88
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,120
when the parents were no long their

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,040
parents my grandparents were no longer

90
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,399
there um there was certain friction that

91
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,959
started coming in and there was a unfair

92
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,000
distribution of wealth that happens

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,880
everywhere no all the time I I it does

94
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,759
there are a lot of stories I experienced

95
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
it for the first time and with my own

96
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,160
father uh I think even at that point of

97
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,800
time I couldn't imagine how can your own

98
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,080
real you know blood do this to you it

99
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,560
was it was very complicated and my

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,120
father I've seen him trust his brother

101
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,400
like like elder brother he used to

102
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
consider him his father because he

103
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,479
wasn't there and uh that trust getting

104
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,360
broken was like an eye opener for me my

105
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,199
first experience into any kind of

106
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,680
relation ship and how uh it has such a

107
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,680
strong impact on who you are or your own

108
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,639
ability or or the like you being able to

109
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,880
trust anyone else after that what age

110
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,240
were you when uh your father and his

111
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
brothers thing happen I was in standard

112
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,680
8 so I think 12 13 13 14 years whatever

113
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,639
that is yeah I have a theory okay I feel

114
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
like great entrepreneurs such as

115
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,080
yourself when are asked the question why

116
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,639
you successful often give the

117
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:38,400
very generic rehearse thing that is

118
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,120
common to everybody but I feel like it's

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,000
not because somebody's trying to lie but

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,039
we don't realize ourselves what

121
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,240
insecurities we have deep inside which

122
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,440
pushed us to do a certain thing yes

123
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,319
hence a little unusual background

124
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,600
absolutely so for that matter over the

125
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
years and this is very recent last two

126
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,199
to three years what I've realized

127
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:03,440
is the reason for my success is not

128
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,000
because of anything that I've done in

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,720
the last 5 to seven years of building

130
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,759
the business it actually goes back to my

131
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,800
childhood and the way my attitude got

132
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,759
shaped because of different events that

133
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,599
happened and the perspective towards

134
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:18,919
looking at some of those beat problems

135
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,840
beat circumstances beat the attitude of

136
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,919
how do you take a decision has shaped

137
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,199
because of certain incidents which have

138
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
happened which I might not have liked

139
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,720
back then when I was going through them

140
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,319
but truly have shaped me to be the

141
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,840
person that I am so what changed in you

142
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,160
guzzled the person were you a good

143
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,639
student age 12 I was always a very good

144
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,840
student for that matter till grade 10 I

145
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,680
was amongst the top five in my class I

146
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,840
was the sports captain and I was also

147
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,080
the best artist in the entire school

148
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,599
okay so the overachieving allrounder

149
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,639
overachieving guzzle at age 12 young

150
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,520
girl going to a school in

151
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,919
chandigar watches her father father and

152
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,680
her brothers his brothers go through a

153
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,360
difficult time what changed in you pre

154
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,000
and post that

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,039
event I think one thing that I realized

156
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,319
for the first time in my life was the

157
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,120
helplessness that I had in that

158
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,879
situation helplessness around money

159
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,759
right helplessness around comforting my

160
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,840
father money didn't come into the

161
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,840
picture then because it took a while for

162
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,680
me to realized that okay now money is

163
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
also a

164
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,160
problem did your lifestyle change yes it

165
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,919
did

166
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,919
because um what he got was under a lot

167
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,000
of debt and we had to sort of as a

168
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,039
family take care of that um and when

169
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,599
suddenly because it was an unexpected

170
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,159
event in his life right he he broke down

171
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,919
and I saw him breaking down for the

172
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,319
first time a very confident funloving

173
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,080
person that he was I saw him getting

174
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,919
very quiet not talking to people not

175
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,479
going out and I I I could feel that he's

176
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,039
going into depression right what I also

177
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,240
saw saw at that point of time was the

178
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,720
power that my mother had to correct the

179
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,280
situations and she had been a housewife

180
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,360
all through her life um it was beautiful

181
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,240
um she pulled out all her gold

182
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,080
saving sold it brought in some money

183
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,080
helped Papa put inventory back into the

184
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,599
shot into the shop what was business so

185
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,120
he was into accessories of all of these

186
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,639
cars and trucks like that entire

187
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,639
business I still don't know how to call

188
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,159
it out yeah yeah all of that right I

189
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,559
still don't know how to how to

190
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,599
accurately describe the business um but

191
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,039
that's what my brother still continues

192
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,440
to do by the

193
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,200
way uh but he was into that but um the

194
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,279
division happened in a way that the shop

195
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:49,000
that he got was under a lot of debt

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,600
there were a lot of like uh receivables

197
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,440
that had to be recovered from the market

198
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,279
and we knew that was like a dead money

199
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,279
already he knew that it was a dead money

200
00:08:58,279 --> 00:08:59,800
it was not going to come and how much

201
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,200
debt to attribute a number to it I think

202
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,120
it would be anywhere between 40 to 50

203
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,839
lakhs back then that was a big amount

204
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,399
like it it crumbled the versus income of

205
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:13,519
four five LHS a year I don't think

206
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,200
you'll be able to versus an income of

207
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,160
around a lakh a month right yeah so that

208
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,240
was the kind of debt that we were

209
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,640
looking at and he could clearly see for

210
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,600
the next 4 5 years this is not going to

211
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,000
come in and for me to put an inventory I

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,720
don't have anything left so what do I do

213
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,399
and with a little bit of money that like

214
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,720
the fact that a housewife can actually

215
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,200
stand up and contribute to situations

216
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
like this was again a first for me

217
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,399
because mama is always sitting at home

218
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,000
she's the caretaker so my um you know

219
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,279
the belief that you you as a woman do

220
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,160
have the ability to change things around

221
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,279
because I hadn't seen anything like that

222
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,880
in my family ever before came from her

223
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,720
that source of inspiration came from her

224
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,160
and I think that incident of course of

225
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,839
course after that things started getting

226
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,680
better slowly and steadily it took us

227
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,200
almost 5 years to come out of that uh

228
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,279
debt to start making money um but the

229
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,240
conversations that I had with my father

230
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,120
during those five years were beautiful I

231
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,240
think the first lesson that he told me

232
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,560
was B Money only comes home when the

233
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,640
business makes profit that was my first

234
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,680
lesson ever that if any business if it's

235
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,959
not making profit the money doesn't come

236
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,040
home it it might be gener Revenue but

237
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,959
that keeps getting you know there's a

238
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:33,760
cycle that is that exists in the

239
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,320
business and it keeps rotating um I also

240
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,000
saw uh my mom step up by taking tutions

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,519
for smaller kids trying to help the

242
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,600
family and I saw how they both

243
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,360
beautifully came together and that was

244
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,800
another lesson that I learned in

245
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,519
relationship building of how to be more

246
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,720
like your mother or your

247
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,560
father H very interesting

248
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,000
I think I want to be more like my

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,680
mother uh the courage that the that she

250
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,760
showed in that situation uh when when

251
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,200
Papa was breaking down um and the will

252
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,079
that she had that this is not going to

253
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:14,440
define the rest of our lives and we are

254
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,720
going to turn it around is the

255
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,720
confidence that I still hold in myself I

256
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,880
always refer back to that incident and I

257
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,680
whenever things are tough I'm like we

258
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,360
will turn it around this doesn't Define

259
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,480
okay uh who we are going to be and then

260
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,720
after

261
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,880
30 yeah so after that continue to grow I

262
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,279
think um value of money is what we

263
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,480
realized then importance of money and

264
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,639
how do you spend it and how do you so

265
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,160
there was a fixed budget in which you

266
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,200
had to manage the house all of all of

267
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,240
those learning started coming in during

268
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,399
that time um as a student I was doing

269
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,760
well in school um plus one plus two so

270
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,959
good in maths good in science doing well

271
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,560
Mama had this dream that because it was

272
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,079
a trend back then to be an engineer

273
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:05,639
right take up engineering and do that so

274
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,040
good in Ms and science you're going to

275
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,120
become an engineer and like you're like

276
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,320
okay you don't know what's in store and

277
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,519
is that when you left chandigar I didn't

278
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,480
leave chandigar even then okay it goes

279
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,519
on with me for the longest period of My

280
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,320
Life um I took uh non-medical as

281
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,880
subjects um and I was also under this

282
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,320
impression that you know everybody used

283
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,639
to say that

284
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:30,680
10th then you have some time free to

285
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,279
yourselves and I took it very seriously

286
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,399
see that's a lie that everybody's

287
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,760
told for Life 10 12th for undergrad it's

288
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,880
a never ending thing R get your first

289
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,920
job get the promotion get married have

290
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,199
children get your first

291
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:51,240
house so after the 10th you were still

292
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,320
like grade a student till 10th after

293
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,920
that then life changed for me completely

294
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,240
I took that after that you can relax but

295
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,120
seriously did you come to terms with the

296
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,079
fact that you're good-looking after

297
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:05,839
10th oh no no that's another story life

298
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
changed how good looking to I picture

299
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,079
like where where's

300
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,959
that

301
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,399
old why I say that's a completely

302
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,880
different story because again for the

303
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,480
longest period of time I thought I was

304
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,720
the most horrible looking girl that

305
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,560
could exist

306
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,480
especially wow till grade 12 okay um

307
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,800
reason being you had bad self-image till

308
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,880
great well uh just on the beauty side of

309
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,639
it on how I physicality of on on the

310
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,920
physicality of it

311
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,079
um I had a dark complexion compared to

312
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,440
the other girls that I was studying um

313
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,279
with I was very tall and for the longest

314
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,800
period of time I thought this was

315
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,320
something which is odd because last one

316
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,160
in the in the

317
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,160
RO and like the the smallest one and all

318
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,600
the girls used to F in the early in the

319
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,920
morning you know you're great your last

320
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,680
to stand oh yeah all the girls used to

321
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
fit in like the first five rows and I

322
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,800
used to be in the 12th 13th row back

323
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,079
with the boys right when did that change

324
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,399
um that changed after uh grade 12 when I

325
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,480
when the boy at the attention from the

326
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,519
boys started coming in and I started

327
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,079
getting compliments again chandigar MCM

328
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,759
DAV which is a girls in chandigar

329
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:31,839
everybody's good-looking so

330
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,000
differentiating is hard right yeah Stu

331
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,720
not every I take that as a compliment

332
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,600
again but yeah chandigar um I don't know

333
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,279
them for me the definition of good-look

334
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,959
has changed considerably from there um

335
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,800
so I always used to think that I am not

336
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
this person all all good-look people say

337
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,480
that like you know good-looking is

338
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,199
relative and all that let me let me

339
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,839
redefine it for you yeah did you get if

340
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,600
your class had

341
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,399
did you get more attention than majority

342
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:07,040
of the class from men or

343
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,240
boys till grade 10 no post grade 12 yeah

344
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,680
post grade 10 yes okay okay so grade 12

345
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,079
you that actually worked well for me by

346
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:19,440
the way because it it did help me

347
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,480
realize that I'm not probably as bad I

348
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,360
it's it's okay I think but even there it

349
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,800
was my mother who changed it around what

350
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,399
does that do for a girl like I I will

351
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,000
never never know this cuz I can't

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,279
resonate with how a girl would feel but

353
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,480
when a girl gets male

354
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,560
attention and is appreciated or is

355
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,759
wanted from a very like emotional lens

356
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,600
is wanted by many

357
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,519
people desirable what does it do to you

358
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,240
like how do you feel is it validation of

359
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,279
something is it an insecurity going away

360
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,839
how do you feel so for me it was an

361
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,360
insecurity going away and me becoming

362
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,639
more confident in my appearance for

363
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,560
example you have farewells right in

364
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,800
schools fairwell parties Etc and you

365
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,160
have to dress up and you have these

366
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,480
events which are happening ramps Etc all

367
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,240
the kids participate I never used to

368
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,040
participate in that I never had the

369
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,120
confidence to go up the stage I never

370
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,480
had the confidence that if I dress up

371
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,920
and style my hair I will end up looking

372
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,360
good so that that emotion was so strong

373
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,000
that I used to avoid events like these

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,120
my mother realized that I was trying to

375
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,639
avoid some of these events because I had

376
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,440
I was image conscious and I felt I

377
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,959
wasn't beautiful is when she brought in

378
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:42,560
a lot of magazines at home and she

379
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,920
started talking to me about a few models

380
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,759
and I was not interested in in that

381
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:50,199
space at all and just for me to feel a

382
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:52,920
little more confident on how I looked

383
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,600
she started complimenting me at home for

384
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,279
anything like any weird thing that I

385
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,120
what year was this around 20

386
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,240
this was in grade 12 I clearly remember

387
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,519
2004

388
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,079
2005 yeah around that time yes okay so

389
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,039
guzzle got good-looking great 12th boys

390
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,919
I get good look I was still looking the

391
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,799
same boys started running behind guzzle

392
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,280
went to college in

393
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,079
chandigar and what next yeah I wouldn't

394
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,720
say boy started running behind me

395
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,520
nothing of that but yeah a little bit of

396
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,880
attention work what is

397
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,039
he I don't

398
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,520
know okay now this is my analogy no no

399
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
this not

400
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,120
therapy asking questions some of these

401
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,000
years are so so like yes so much happens

402
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,320
on so many different levels be it your

403
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,600
family side be it the person that you're

404
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,760
becoming be it your attitude towards

405
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,480
things be friends and all of that it

406
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,880
forms you as a person

407
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,440
and I mean 12th again was a very very

408
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,360
difficult year for me because I realized

409
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,919
that engineering was not something that

410
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,400
I wanted to do I also realized that my

411
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,840
parents didn't have money and they

412
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,799
figured from somewhere and they spent so

413
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,520
much on the coachings that you have to

414
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
take to prepare for the entrance exams

415
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Etc and I was wasting that money I was

416
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,960
becoming more confident on how I looked

417
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,320
so on the image side of it I was

418
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,640
realizing the importance of different

419
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,679
relationships and how it's very

420
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,880
important to have few people in life but

421
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,440
have them really close to you I also

422
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,080
experienced a lot of friends moving away

423
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,159
and the pain that it causes because

424
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,400
somebody can be your best friend today

425
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,080
and tomorrow because the school changes

426
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,760
the college changes um you know the the

427
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,000
they've picked up you've picked up

428
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,320
computers they've picked up something

429
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,080
else that relationship changes and they

430
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,640
move on in life and that was are you

431
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,039
like that now did you become a person

432
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,159
who really gives importance to loyalty

433
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:55,080
when you watched what happened between

434
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,200
your father and his brothers when you

435
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,600
were 1213 and and has that continued at

436
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,960
Mama Earth today is loyalty a big thing

437
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,080
so to till today loyalty is the most

438
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
important thing for me in any

439
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,480
relationship be it with my employees be

440
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,960
it with my family be it with my any kind

441
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,880
of relationships or

442
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,679
friends

443
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,039
I if it gets broken once it's very

444
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,280
difficult for me to be that same

445
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,240
person with that uh person

446
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,760
unforgiving not unforgiving but I don't

447
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,159
forget it there's a difference I will

448
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:36,440
forgive the person but I will not forget

449
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,360
what happened and that feeling stays

450
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,880
with me because of which I'm not able to

451
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,240
be that same person again do you think

452
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,600
that's a good thing or a bad thing I

453
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,360
think it's a very bad thing it does more

454
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,840
harm to me than anybody else

455
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,080
and I want to let it go I've tried

456
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,640
really hard that this should move away I

457
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,280
should be that person who doesn't care

458
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,600
Etc it's been all like so many years now

459
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,080
but I haven't been able to change it a

460
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,520
bit that's why actually I I forget but I

461
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,799
don't forgive so and and I forget like

462
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,000
this I don't remember anything this is

463
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,039
better that's a blessing I just don't

464
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,760
remember that person forting is the same

465
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,720
as

466
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,799
forgiving that's it's a blessing if you

467
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,080
can do that trust me and it's only

468
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
because that work pulls me so hard that

469
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,600
I I kind of forget everything which is

470
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,799
around me okay just finish on guzzle

471
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,919
okay you went to college then yeah so

472
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,000
College I was like a very aggressive

473
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
because of what had happened uh with my

474
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,039
dad and all of that time one thing that

475
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,840
my mother told me was you know how you

476
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,280
have these parties like I talked about

477
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,760
the fawell parties or you want to go out

478
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,880
with your friends for a for a movie or

479
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,679
for a lunch Etc everybody pulls in money

480
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
right and when I had when you have to

481
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
pull in money at that age you're asking

482
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,000
your parents to give you some money or a

483
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,080
pocket money right um and one day um

484
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,120
like I saw some crazy discussion but I

485
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,640
saw my mom telling me I don't have the

486
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,880
money to give you so I can't go and this

487
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,200
happened two three times uh I don't know

488
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,520
what the reason was behind that but

489
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,440
either she actually did not have money

490
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,000
or she wanted me to learn something out

491
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
of it or value money more whatever that

492
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,679
was um there's this one line that she

493
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,840
said when I said that you know what

494
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,799
you're not giving me money like how do I

495
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,000
do everybody gets it I will make my own

496
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,279
money so she said Till the time time

497
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,640
you're taking money from anybody else

498
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,520
whoever you are taking it from will make

499
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,559
decisions for you the day you start

500
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:38,360
earning your own money is the day you

501
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,679
get to choose where to spend it

502
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,360
on and that is what I took with me all

503
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,520
through these years and when I entered

504
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,720
College I so College is very liberating

505
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,480
right unlike school where you have a

506
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,000
fixed routine College you also have some

507
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,520
time and you know you're I have no idea

508
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:58,679
never went to college

509
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:01,320
it's it's it's Liber it's liberating in

510
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,240
the sense that you have more time to

511
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,600
yourself than you had while you were in

512
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,880
school you also have a little more

513
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,279
freedom because you have your own

514
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:11,039
vehicle you have to go to college you

515
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,880
have to take classes then you're taking

516
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,320
coaching Etc um I actually used that

517
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,600
opportunity and I tried to find a job

518
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,039
for myself because I said College I have

519
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,799
to have my own money if I want to spend

520
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,679
it my way how do I make money I started

521
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,480
taking tutions um

522
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,720
figure out what were you teaching maths

523
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,520
and science two students who were like

524
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,320
pre 10th till 10th I would say little

525
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,919
guzzles yeah little little guzzles like

526
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,400
um but I was teaching everything because

527
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
my objective was not I was not focused

528
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
on what I'm teaching I was focused on

529
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,799
what's the money that's coming in and

530
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,480
how much am I able to make right so

531
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,120
tutions College on the side College

532
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,720
tution on the side and that's the time

533
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,640
when I also picked up my passion for

534
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,720
computer TS because I had experienced it

535
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,480
as an elective subject in grade 10 grade

536
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,200
11 12th it got taken away from me and I

537
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,559
was missing it like crazy so I realized

538
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,120
that that's my passion so when I went to

539
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,600
my parents saying you know engineering

540
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,520
is not something that I want to do and I

541
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,880
didn't sit for the entrance exams with a

542
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,200
fear that what if I get through then

543
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
I'll be pushed towards pursuing this as

544
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,320
a career so didn't do that uh and

545
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,000
instead said regular College highi

546
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,640
college regular college that has minimal

547
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,600
fee MCM DAV it's all girls college and

548
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,880
on the side while I'll take tutions I'll

549
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,559
also figure out what is it that I want

550
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,480
to do and I picked up computers I joined

551
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,480
niit there was this course 2 and a half

552
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,760
year course called gni it which

553
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,440
basically gave you exposure towards

554
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,799
multiple different languages and

555
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,600
softwares so that's something that I

556
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,080
picked up and I thoroughly enjoyed it I

557
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,320
loved it so much that I went to my

558
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,799
principal in college I said this is

559
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,799
something that I'm doing

560
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,799
I'm working really hard I want you to

561
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,640
give me some time off college hours

562
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
because attendance used to be a concern

563
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,760
there and you had to have like a minimum

564
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,520
uh I think she understood my passion or

565
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,880
I don't know what happened she gave me

566
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,440
that permission that okay you're taking

567
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,919
this another course you're doing really

568
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,320
well there every 6 months you used to

569
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,919
get a score card that I had to submit at

570
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,039
college but continue to do that um but

571
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,520
when I picked that up I had to leave the

572
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,159
tuition so the money that was coming in

573
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,080
the comfort of of having your own U you

574
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,840
know little what that 2 3,000 at that

575
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
point of time it was right but it was a

576
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,640
lot it was my I could choose to spend it

577
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,559
on a dress that I want or go out with my

578
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,640
friend how 18 18 17 178 1718 that money

579
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,840
went away but the hunger for money still

580
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,120
stayed so when I was taking this why is

581
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,720
that I've heard this from a lot of

582
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,559
people I think rates will resonate if

583
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,720
you make if one were to equate money

584
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,279
with power yeah power corrupts above all

585
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,080
else right right the more power you have

586
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:02,760
the more you want there is no concept of

587
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,880
being Satisfied by virtue of power mhm

588
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,880
why do you think most people when they

589
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,760
get it might be a bad analogy but the

590
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,080
taste of money early wants so much more

591
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,000
in a very precocious manner where they

592
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,279
want it so quickly what is it about

593
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:22,480
money I think ear early on absolutely

594
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,080
that's one of the things early on in

595
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,159
your journey when you taste money and

596
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,039
you're able to and that's only my view I

597
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,480
don't know uh you're able to experience

598
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,240
the Comforts that it brings right

599
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,559
Comfort could be a mental comfort that I

600
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,240
have this cushion it could be the things

601
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,760
that I'm able to buy it could be

602
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,919
experiences that I'm able to take is it

603
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:45,720
that or is it when your father split he

604
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,279
was depressed lifestyle changed that's

605
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,200
so ingrained in your subconscious that

606
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,520
when you made money your

607
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,840
subconscious was thinking that you're

608
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,320
solving what happened to you as a

609
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,360
12-year-old cuz the Comfort is

610
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,799
irrelevant everybody gets happy when

611
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,559
they get things so

612
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,320
I I would phrase it that I I went

613
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,760
through the discomfort that happens when

614
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,480
you don't have money at 12:13 right yeah

615
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,640
the biggest trigger there yes and I also

616
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,039
saw my dad break down so subconsciously

617
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,679
in my mind money was a very very

618
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,960
important tool for you to be happy so

619
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,640
when you started earning it was not the

620
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,880
shoe or bag you bought but oh no deep

621
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,559
down it was

622
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,320
that problem that you didn't want to go

623
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,200
back and address in your own mind even

624
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,000
slightly mind I was taking pressure off

625
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,320
my parents by not asking them for money

626
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,000
and that was my way to help them which I

627
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,720
was not able to do when I was you know

628
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,559
but I believe n once you've truly

629
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,360
been and you know again poor is a

630
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,600
relative term but I think once you've

631
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,760
really been through trouble right like

632
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,679
when you basically to put food on the

633
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,320
table is uh a challenge you never want

634
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,720
to go back to it I think that feeling of

635
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,600
remembering back um uh that specific

636
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,159
period is it's such a stark feeling I

637
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:11,760
think that's a very obvious thing though

638
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,559
someone someone who is hungry knows the

639
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,120
someone who was hungry correct knows the

640
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,480
advantage of not being hungry today yeah

641
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,159
I'm trying to get it what is the emotion

642
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,760
that got ingrained in your brain when

643
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,720
you were

644
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,120
hungry makes sense makes sense like now

645
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,520
that you've asked that question and I'm

646
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,919
thinking about it I haven't thought

647
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:34,720
about it earlier right um for me that

648
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,200
emotion

649
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,080
still it stayed even when we started

650
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,120
Mama Earth out because I did not have

651
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,080
any experience in beauty or personal

652
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,279
care I had no intention of building a

653
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:48,679
business I I'm an artist as well I was

654
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:49,880
selling my Works nationally

655
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,440
internationally back then doing really

656
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,080
well can I ask you a question yeah who

657
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,480
are your favorite artists my favorite

658
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,919
they say that kind of artti you like

659
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,080
tells you a lot about a person is it so

660
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,919
my favorite artist is SEMA Ki followed

661
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,840
by paresh Mei both of these are Indian

662
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,159
artists I know I've met them I've I've

663
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:09,399
seen their work I've taken a lot of tell

664
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:12,360
some International dead ones I love Wang

665
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,120
off and I love Picasso which painting if

666
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,279
you say Picasso do you like his red face

667
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,080
his blue face do you like cubism I like

668
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,399
cubism the most you will also see it a

669
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,480
bit of it in my work

670
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,440
why um there is so much depth

671
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,120
I think cubism was not him originally

672
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,240
saan started it he got inspired right I

673
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,120
think it was the first time when some

674
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,480
artist did not depict something as it is

675
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,679
but took a derivative of it and that

676
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,760
appealed to but my favorite works of

677
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,440
Picasso have been on the lines of cubism

678
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,000
I just feel that when you put those

679
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,919
lines to form certain shapes um and I

680
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:56,720
don't know how true that is but there is

681
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
so much inter interpretation or there is

682
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,240
so much depth to it that you can pull

683
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,279
out um every time I look at these

684
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,840
paintings I feel a different emotion and

685
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,720
it goes back to how I am feeling at that

686
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,240
point of time when I'm looking at the

687
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,440
painting um I I just and that's

688
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,200
something that I wish I'm able to bring

689
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,600
out through my work and how how long

690
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,159
after college did mam start just out of

691
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,240
curiosity so I spent uh almost 3 and 1

692
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,679
half years with an it then I was an

693
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,840
artist for 2 and a half years and uh

694
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
after that 2 years I was working in

695
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,360
India and after that M happened

696
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,919
so almost uh almost 7 years not long 7

697
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,799
7even and a half years uh when I had my

698
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,760
son is when M happened really so which

699
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,360
year did you start mama so Mama started

700
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,640
because of my son when I became a mama

701
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,080
wow

702
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,559
yeah is that why you called it

703
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,320
mama uh the mama word did come from

704
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,399
there but there were a lot of other

705
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,200
reasons as well right now the mama story

706
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,399
has been told already so I don't I won't

707
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,080
go into that too much but uh niit then

708
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,919
what did you say yeah so studied at

709
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,880
niit while studying at niit took up my

710
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,919
first job with an IIT which was a

711
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,559
corporate trainer uh no experience just

712
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,279
because High

713
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,480
Mama suit went gave an interview got

714
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,919
cleared next day they asked us to give

715
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,519
whatever documents we had because they

716
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,320
had to finalize it is when they realize

717
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,080
that I don't my age is not El eligible I

718
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,640
don't have any prior experience and I'm

719
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,760
a student of niit so I can't take the

720
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,640
role up convinced them in some way that

721
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,880
give me one if it doesn't work out I

722
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,039
won't charge for it like I was doing it

723
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,960
for money right there was no other

724
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,799
reason um uh but but they were kind

725
00:30:57,799 --> 00:31:00,080
enough to give me that one opportunity

726
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,159
learned on the job had no idea how to

727
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,399
train people like this was a training

728
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,279
that I was taking for um people who were

729
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,080
in their 40s to 50 50 years of age

730
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
bracket who had been working with their

731
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,279
company for almost you know 10 to 15

732
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,360
years and I was the one who was taking a

733
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,440
software that niit had built to them

734
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,000
saying I will teach you how you can do

735
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,120
your work better that was also the first

736
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,399
time I experienced that confidence can

737
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:28,840
be

738
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,240
faked because I was I I had my legs were

739
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
shivering when I entered that room I was

740
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,200
a student and I was supposed to become

741
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,880
their teacher and tell them how can you

742
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,559
use this software that I had also

743
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:46,279
learned just 7 10 days back and sort of

744
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,399
you know it's learning on the job but

745
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:49,880
this is the number one competency in

746
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,399
entrepreneurship that you have to be

747
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:53,840
confident no matter what but really you

748
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,679
have no idea what's going to happen next

749
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,519
I know but again I think on the flip

750
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,200
side uh I always think what can go wrong

751
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,919
worst case I'll be thrown out of it any

752
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:05,240
which don't have it so

753
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,919
like I will eventually like once I

754
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,039
complete the course yeah so that's okay

755
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:14,720
the downside was so low like the risk of

756
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,519
failing was so low that then confidently

757
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,760
and you pitch it and you take those

758
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,639
trainings how did you come like I know

759
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:25,840
there's a onion oil yeah which has

760
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,720
played a big part in this the story I

761
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,399
want to know a bit more about

762
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:32,480
that how did you go from niit to being

763
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,519
an artist I'm guessing you sold a

764
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,799
reasonable amount of art did fairly well

765
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,960
yeah how did what kind of art did you

766
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,840
make so I'm also into semi abstraction

767
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,360
inspired by these guys okay so you were

768
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,000
doing decently as an artist you were

769
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,960
married by this time yeah yeah

770
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,639
so so niit did that eventually ended up

771
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,600
taking that as my main job did that

772
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,080
about for for about 3 and a half years

773
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,960

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,679

one who arranged it between us of course

777
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,600
Baron and I were chatting on social

778
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,120
media before that because you used to

779
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,039

00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,240
he asked me when we met right not

787
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,679
exactly the first question but during

788
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:39,919

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,200
marriage U why don't had to move to

799
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,519
Philippines for his job and because we

800
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,320
were in this new relationship still

801
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,280
trying to figure each other out and the

802
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,040
relationship out and you don't want to

803
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,560
be I I took a call that I will leave my

804
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,639
job and I'll move to Philippines with

805
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,399
him so when I moved to Philippines is

806
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,839
where I had a lot of ample time I picked

807
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:27,000
up this passion for painting uh I think

808
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,960
one day I just pulled out some paints

809
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,560
and canvases and I painted and I didn't

810
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:34,520
realize I was painting the entire night

811
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,480
till morning about 6:37 and by the time

812
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,560
vun woke up I had like four five works

813
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,839
ready to be hung on the wall and he was

814
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,119
super surprised so without telling me he

815
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,719
actually submitted my Works to a couple

816
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,918
of colleges internationally because

817
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,280
earlier he had asked you know what's

818
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,760
your passion I said painting is my

819
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,440
passion whenever I get time I'll pick it

820
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,320
up he asked that would you like he

821
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,280
didn't know it's that Series yeah he was

822
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,920
very surprised so he asked me that

823
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,440
question that back then when we were

824
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,320
getting married right that if given a

825
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,160
chance would you want to pursue it

826
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,720
professionally and I had said yes so

827
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,520
yeah without telling me sent the works

828
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,800
to the academy couple of colleges I got

829
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,920
a call from New York Academy of Arts to

830
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,480
come there and pursue uh artist with

831
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,280
them uh you know the course with them it

832
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,640
was a 9mon uh course and what

833
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,440
year this was right right into our

834
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,160
marriage we got married in 2011 so this

835
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,320
was

836
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,680
2012 uh we spent about 6 months in

837
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,160
Philippines while I was doing all of

838
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,400
this um so 2011 2012 is when this

839
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,720
happened and

840
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,760
um before even when the call came he did

841
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,240
not tell me the call has come he figured

842
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,040
out that if I have to go to that place

843
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,000
where do I stay how do I manage because

844
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,960
he knew that this girl has never been

845
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,240
out of chandigar let alone going to New

846
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,480
York and pursuing this he figured all

847
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,040
the nitty-gritty is

848
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,319
out how will she manage etc etc and when

849
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:03,480
everything was

850
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,079
sorted that's when he said that if I

851
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,880
tell you you can go to New York Academy

852
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,480
of Arts would you go I said of course I

853
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,480
would love to go with an assumption that

854
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,079
he'll go with me um he said uh that's

855
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,880
when he said that a call has come uh but

856
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,119
you'll have to go

857
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,560
alone uh because he was also new into

858
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,520
his uh journey of uh you know handling

859
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,359
southeast Asia markets but um I said no

860
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,119
and then he convinced me to take the

861
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,200
risk go there alone figure it out yes

862
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,960
good husband

863
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,359

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,000

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,599
us we have to make sure that we sound

866
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,040
good for our

867
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,880
wives yeah so when there then first year

868
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,960
old but gone no no I really wish that g

869
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,560
also say the same things about me but I

870
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,800
have no idea we I'll only find out but

871
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,160
please go on you would know you need

872
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,520
start that first together right yeah of

873
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,880
course but look we we've dated each

874
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,760
other now for what 11 years so ever

875
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,480
since high school so there's probably a

876
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,079
longer context but we'll come to it

877
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,280
later enjoyed my time there um went for

878
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,760
a very different course which was

879
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,640
realism where you paint photo like real

880
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,520
pictures old school impressionist yes

881
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,119
and hated it still life was learning

882
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,720
that I signed up for that course I got

883
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,680
invited for and I hated it uh and then I

884
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,560
I still remember like one of these Side

885
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,280
Opportunities came in which was a call

886
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,760
for artists and you can submit your

887
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,520
artworks and I created something that I

888
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,640
felt like in in I think 3 hours and I

889
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,400
submitted that work and it got selected

890
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,119
to be exhibited at New York Academy of

891
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,640
Arts it was up in their Gallery until

892
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,680
about 2 years back that is what gave me

893
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,480
me confidence that again it's not about

894
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,839
what you know or what you are learning

895
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:04,760
something entirely different caught the

896
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,520
attention of my teachers and it got

897
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,040
selected so then that's where I started

898
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,560
my journey around Painting came back to

899
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,400
India started exhibiting Works started

900
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
getting sold was doing really well I

901
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,599
thought that was something that I wanted

902
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,520
to do for the rest of my life how how

903
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,880
Mama I'm still wonder yeah so Mama Earth

904
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,720
happened after this while I was an

905
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,200
artist we went on our family rout I was

906
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,839
expecting austa happened um what year

909
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,880
right we used to have a lot of like our

910
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,440
doctor used to call us Google parents

911
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,560
because we were Googling each and

912
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,359
everything around baby you're so worried

913
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:46,119
as a new parent that you would end up

914
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,800
breaking the baby that I mean we were

915
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,560
like hell lot of paranoid set of parents

916
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,839
not just me set of parents our japa made

917
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,319
which helps you with the baby for the

918
00:38:57,319 --> 00:39:00,800
first months left in 15 days she said

919
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,920
you guys don't let me do anything why

920
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,359
have you signed me up she left in 15

921
00:39:04,359 --> 00:39:06,319
days the child like this and you have to

922
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:07,960
see it when she does this and you can't

923
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,440
do that right so we were we didn't allow

924
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,520
her to feed the baby we didn't allow her

925
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,319
to sleep with the baby we didn't allow

926
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:16,319
her to Bath the baby everything we were

927
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:19,200
doing ourselves so she left and a doctor

928
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,280
also was saying the same things Google

929
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,960
parents Etc I think it was after that

930
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,640
where um Augusta started having some

931
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,119
skin reactions because of which I

932
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:29,680
realized that the products that we were

933
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,680
using on him were not good enough we

934
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,280
started ordering from outside of India

935
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,599
and those products were suiting him

936
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,960
really well so that is how um you know

937
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,240
as a cribbing wife I went to vun why is

938
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,280
why

939
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,800
inia why don't we have regulations we

940
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,280
not have any regulations were you

941
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,800
ordering from outside so there's this

942
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,119
brand called Baby ganx okay and there is

943
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,000
this brand called honest yeah J

944
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,359
yes I was ordering products from these

945
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:01,440
two Brands and holding it like crazy

946
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,880
cupboard full of cupo they were all like

947
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,520
organic natural organic very low you

948
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,599
know food gr preservatives Etc and we

949
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,400
did not have anything like that in India

950
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,680
India was even the products that were

951
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,960
calling themselves out as the world

952
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,240
whatever was existing that was my I

953
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,400
shouldn't that was my trigger that was

954
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,000
my trigger because whenever anybody has

955
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,280
a new baby maximum number of gift sets

956
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,680
come from the brand that you said right

957
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,839
Johnson's and Johnson's I

958
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:36,960
see yeah my first achievement

959
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,560
was it's not Indian brand so say

960
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,079
more so that was my trigger right that

961
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:45,040
was I was like this is just not

962
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,599
acceptable outside of India and because

963
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:49,000
I had lived in New York I knew back in

964
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,599
New York there was this whole movement

965
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:53,560
around J&J going on where their tal had

966
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,359
some cancer causing ingredients in them

967
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:56,480
and they were being taken off the

968
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,200
shelves so I knew that there's something

969
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,880
off with the brand because I used to use

970
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,040
that tal back then when I came to India

971
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,640
and I was getting all of those gift sets

972
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,119
and then internationally those

973
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,520
controversies are happening and India

974
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,280
also started getting those cases is when

975
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,599
it it was it was like a very strong

976
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,599
trigger that how can this come close to

977
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:20,280
any of our babies is there regulation

978
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,000
now which makes it harder for stuff like

979
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,440
that to come in I don't think there's

980
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,520
any regulation per se but that's what we

981
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,000
sold for through India I don't think

982
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,960
there is there is so for example aush

983
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,000
would have brought in certain rules um

984
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,520
on the ingredient usage Etc and how do

985
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,280
they certify products to be uh I

986
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,680
certified but back then there wasn't so

987
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,839
you you figured

988
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,160
India banana so what is the how do you

989
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,359
go from there to making a product yeah

990
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,920
so like like a very brief conversation

991
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,880
between me and Von where I'm saying

992
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,800
ordering products is so crazy you're

993
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,960
you're like tracking friends and family

994
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,280
who's

995
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:11,119
going right it was so much pain and I

996
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:13,680
just went as a cribbing wife I said why

997
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,599
this problem needs to be

998
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:19,000
solved and he just made one statement he

999
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,440
said if nobody else is doing it why

1000
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,000
don't you give it a

1001
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,880
try and that statement stuck I think all

1002
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,839
through my life i' I'm just realizing

1003
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:27,920
now that there have been certain

1004
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,839
statements which have been like uh

1005
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,160
life-changing for me and this was one of

1006
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,319
those statements where he said figure it

1007
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:39,280
out can it be done or not it might be a

1008
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,040
possibility ingredients are only

1009
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,400
available outside and hence it's not

1010
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,839
happening so I got like a lever to I

1011
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:49,720
like I wore that research hat and I went

1012
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,200
mad around figuring out what's happening

1013
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,280
in the baby care industry in Personal

1014
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,319
Care can someone do this if I were a 20

1015
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,480
old girl yeah and I want to start like a

1016
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,920
organic Indian maybe ayurva inspired

1017
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,880
something like that brand can I create a

1018
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,000
oil or a shampoo or a soap or something

1019
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,720
like absolutely and it's not even

1020
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,280
difficult and it doesn't have to be very

1021
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,720
expensive I think all you need to do is

1022
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,400
so for example what is the kind of

1023
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,119
product that I'm trying to

1024
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,520
create what are the kind of ingredients

1025
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,520
that I want the product to

1026
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,720
have where are those ingredients

1027
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,440
available and at what cost tell me I

1028
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,240
want I'm a 21y old girl yeah I want to

1029
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,920
start a shampoo which is very good for

1030
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,280
me yeah don't laugh at me being a 21y

1031
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,079
old girl where do I go about finding out

1032
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,400
laughing at him what goes into a

1033
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,400
shampoo what goes into a shampoo yeah

1034
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,480
how do I get those ingredients and how

1035
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,920
do I put them together you have to have

1036
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,640
a product that you believe in that this

1037
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:59,000
is something truly differentiated and is

1038
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,760
not available in the market or is

1039
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,119
providing convenience or is extremely

1040
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,240
superior but how do I do that shampoo

1041
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,280
how do I make it okay so what we if I

1042
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,880
I'm a 21y old one you Google formulation

1043
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,559
of shampoo very easily available what

1044
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:18,559
are the ingredients that go into it you

1045
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,079
Google I want to make a shampoo at

1046
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,599
home you understand that okay there is a

1047
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:27,000
suant system which causes forming these

1048
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,599
are the ingredients this is what I want

1049
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:32,520
to put the difficult part is to

1050
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,119
understand what are the ingredients that

1051
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:36,960
you want to replace it with and how do

1052
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,440
you go about creating those formulations

1053
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,839
that is where Google might not be able

1054
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:43,880
to help you as much if you don't know

1055
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,480
what do you want to replace it with so

1056
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,400
my journey on creating that product and

1057
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,280
that was a baby shampoo back then

1058
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,480
started by reading the labels of these

1059
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,640
brands that I was sourcing from us

1060
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,119
um that's a good hack right if there's

1061
00:44:58,119 --> 00:44:59,880
something nice out there absolutely

1062
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,880
which is expensive if you have a

1063
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,520
reference point why for cheap yes and

1064
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,079
study the in and out of that product and

1065
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,680
you're trying to say you make that

1066
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,119
assessment and make your own derived

1067
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,040
formula like a no no no no no no for the

1068
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:14,680
for the moment like this could be

1069
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,720
swapped in so now you go to an expert to

1070
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,200
get that validation that's of course

1071
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,079
there but you could do all this within

1072
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,920
yourself in the same I just did

1073
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,400
paperwork I was just on the paper

1074
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,079
studying and trying to understand

1075
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,599
understand what is it that I want to

1076
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,880
build what is it what should a shampoo

1077
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,079
have which will make it milder yet

1078
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,920
effective and be very different from

1079
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,640
what's available in India which was more

1080
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,960
harmful ingredients outside of India

1081
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,920
those ingredients were banned in a few

1082
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,119
countries to be used on a baby skin

1083
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,720
which were being widely used in India

1084
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,359
right so one for example studying I just

1085
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,240
studied us regulation because that's

1086
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,920
where the products were being lifted off

1087
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,920
on what are the us regulation where do

1088
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,240
you find it online fre absolutely freely

1089
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,800
available freely available you stud you

1090
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,760
can study us you can study Europe I did

1091
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,960
all of that Google was my best friend

1092
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,280
and studying these products for example

1093
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,040
going to an honest company's website and

1094
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,319
seeing what are the ingredients that

1095
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,400
they're putting in their product comp

1096
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,160
what is the source you take the name of

1097
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,760
that ingredient you put it on Google it

1098
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,760
tells you what that ingredient does why

1099
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:24,240
is it used for what is the ideal

1100
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,559
percentage etc etc so the only thing

1101
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,200
that I understood out of all of that

1102
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,839
study was the fact that one coconut

1103
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,359
based cleansers exist which can make the

1104
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,599
shampoo far more milder and non irritant

1105
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:41,079
in nature beat for the eyes beat for the

1106
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:44,359
skin and I wanted to replace the harsh

1107
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:46,520
surfectants which were banned in

1108
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,000
countries outside of India but were

1109
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,040
being used in the baby products here

1110
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,599
with the coconut based surfectants

1111
00:46:52,599 --> 00:46:55,880
and then after that I had to reach out

1112
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,240
out to people who could help me build

1113
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,200
formulations and when you're starting

1114
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,280
out how do you find these people yeah so

1115
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,599
like again cool calling cool mailing so

1116
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,000
you can find if I go on Google and say I

1117
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,160
I'm a 21y old girl yeah I think my

1118
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,480
shampoo is horrible yeah I find a

1119
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,079
shampoo a really expensive Honest

1120
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,640
Company shampoo which I really like yeah

1121
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,599
I look at the difference in ingredients

1122
00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:25,800
of that and what is available here yes

1123
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,440
and then I need to find people who will

1124
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,800
make this for me yeah who do I call what

1125
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,640
do I

1126
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,680
Google so here is where LinkedIn helped

1127
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,920
because on LinkedIn you can specifically

1128
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,480
put search people out who are into

1129
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,240
research and development for personal

1130
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,040
care products H interesting right so

1131
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:47,359
that's where LinkedIn came handy and we

1132
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:50,559
uh of course we like pulled out at least

1133
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,480
at least 30 35 40 people that we wanted

1134
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,280
to reach out to we sent we figured their

1135
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,599
email IDs from LinkedIn itself I sent

1136
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,480
cold mails to these people probably out

1137
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,760
of those 353 rted and one out of them

1138
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,960
and what timeline months or no no no

1139
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,559
that I think that ways our system is

1140
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:13,160
good even today if you write a cold

1141
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:15,559
email to somebody I think you most

1142
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:20,200
mostly get a reply um might be different

1143
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,960
now because the definition of

1144
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,200
Entrepreneurship has changed it's not

1145
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,319
that easy in real estate back then there

1146
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,440
was this again you know you have to find

1147
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,000
people who are able to understand what

1148
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,119
you're trying to say we were a set of

1149
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:34,319
parents trying to solve a problem that a

1150
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,280
lot of our friend parents were also

1151
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:39,280
facing how do you establish that connect

1152
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,640
so we wrote a parent couple trying to

1153
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,559
solve a problem as the subject of the

1154
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,200
mail that we had sent out and I think

1155
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,800
that really helped us be it finding the

1156
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,040
right manufacturing partner or finding

1157
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,359
this scientist couple who help us build

1158
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:56,200
uh formulations but that was also true

1159
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,400
right because I did not have I couldn't

1160
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,280
say anything about myself apart from

1161
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,599
being just a mom uh so they reverted

1162
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,799
they um helped us like put basic

1163
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:08,480
formulations together of course they did

1164
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,400
not have any manufacturing units so we

1165
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,200
had to find another partner who could

1166
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,760
manufacture the product for us they are

1167
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,280
the ones who actually gave us access to

1168
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,119
their R&D lab because we did not have

1169
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:21,400
any and that's the beauty of startup

1170
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,079
ecosystem in India right the shared

1171
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,280
infrastructure that exist

1172
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,040
actually eases out building a business

1173
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,319
had it been 10 years back you would you

1174
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:34,240
would not even be able to think about

1175
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,160
something like this because if you had

1176
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,000
to build a formulation you have to have

1177
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,599
your own lab and then have your own

1178
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,079
manufacturing unit otherwise that

1179
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,000
sharing system didn't exist and they'll

1180
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,960
be okay to do five 10 pieces if I were

1181
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,240
to reach out so they give us access to

1182
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,520
their labs labs may you can have hand

1183
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,319
handmade batches not the commerci this

1184
00:49:53,319 --> 00:49:55,920
is not expensive like access access to a

1185
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:57,839
lab so nobody gives you access to their

1186
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,359
lab or their

1187
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,559
resources the only reason why we were

1188
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,760
able to get that was because we went

1189
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,280
crazy like he's still our largest

1190
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,880
manufacturing partner by the way we went

1191
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,319
crazy following up as a 21y old I can

1192
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:16,319
reach out today and get access to a

1193
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:19,480
lab yes I mean you have to have a vision

1194
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,920
and you have to be able to show that

1195
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,880
Vision to others your biggest

1196
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,760
manufacturing partner yeah yeah so Capco

1197
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,920
uh Varun Kapoor and binita again a set

1198
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,240
of parents who had kids similar age as

1199
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,280
uh us um who they said that this is

1200
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:36,040
something that we had also been thinking

1201
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,760
about for the last couple of years a lot

1202
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,559
of people have actually come to us tried

1203
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:40,920
to figure this out but nobody has been

1204
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,680
able to formulate or do something about

1205
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,799
it so are you sure you want to put in

1206
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:47,079
time and effort because nobody has

1207
00:50:47,079 --> 00:50:49,359
cracked it till now but can you imagine

1208
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,000
that I'm but now I'm getting the point

1209
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
where he's going and and since he

1210
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,040
started from your earlier Journey do you

1211
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,599
think today you have manufacturers or

1212
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:01,520
these lab heads who are that welcoming

1213
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,680
to attend a call of a 20-y old and says

1214
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,599
okay or they have somebody meet this so

1215
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:11,040
and so person is there a welcoming

1216
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,119
system in this segment of labs and abely

1217
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:16,559
you think it's still there I mean look

1218
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,680
at the number of startups that have come

1219
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:20,880
up in the beauty and personal care space

1220
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,559
in the last 5 years I would say there'll

1221
00:51:23,559 --> 00:51:25,839
be more today than there were back then

1222
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:28,359
for sure because there moreb there are

1223
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:30,200
Labs the young one calling up you know I

1224
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,000
don't know like young people call me all

1225
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,960
the time I engage with so many of them

1226
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,599
not in I don't have a lab but in other

1227
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,920
domain especially uh last 3

1228
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,640
years this has really changed because a

1229
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,160
lot of people have also experienced

1230
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,040
success and they also understand

1231
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,799
that if you like the idea you should

1232
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:51,680
pursue it with the person I have come to

1233
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,880
terms with that right first three years

1234
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,160
I used us to absolutely ignore whoever

1235
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,200
was writing

1236
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,319
such we were nothing back then uh nobody

1237
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:04,520
used to write as well but today if if

1238
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,319
young people and I'll I'll I'll tell you

1239
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:08,400
a small story a 14-year-old who comes to

1240
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,319
me and says this is the ayura brand that

1241
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,760
I want to create and sits with me for a

1242
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,880
couple of hours

1243
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,240
brainstorms understands how to build a

1244
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,880
business um and is working on it as we

1245
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,960
speak this a real story yeah yeah yeah

1246
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:29,280
14y old 14y old 14 year old and I like

1247
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,599
super surprised at the kind of ideas

1248
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,720
that they have yes they are so sure that

1249
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,240
they will be able to figure it out it is

1250
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,240
beautiful okay so you formulated it you

1251
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,960
met the Capco guys who are your friends

1252
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,240
I'm sure some people are going to hit

1253
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,240
them up after this a lot of people have

1254
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,440
already hit them

1255
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,000
up so you made a baby shampoo which

1256
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,720
worked better we made four products we

1257
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,400
made a baby lotion we made a baby

1258
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,000
shampoo we made a 100% natural mosquito

1259
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,839
repellent and we made a sunscreen so

1260
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:03,160
these were the four products that we

1261
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,280
made we were very clear and each of them

1262
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,000
had a purpose how much did it cost you

1263
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
to get to this point

1264
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,480
nothing this business getting your

1265
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,160
prototypes for example what we were

1266
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,920
working towards was having five pieces

1267
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,200
of each we which we could show to people

1268
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,440
let them experience it sort of figure

1269
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,559
out and give us

1270
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,000
feedback hand bch like working in your

1271
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,400
kitchen it's like beers and you're

1272
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,520
whipping it and you you made hand it's

1273
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,839
not as fine as the commercial batch but

1274
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,880
you know if the formula is okay if the

1275
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,880
feel and texture is okay the commercial

1276
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,799
batch will come out fine right again

1277
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,400
because we were digital first we did not

1278
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,480
have the pressure of number of units

1279
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,440
that need to to be created right because

1280
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,799
we were not Distributing it in one

1281
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:51,400
Warehouse you can produce as low as

1282
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:54,079
5,000 units of per product 3,000 units

1283
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,480
of Peru thatare so it cost it to set up

1284
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,240
the warehous no again we didn't own the

1285
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,160
warehouse shared

1286
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,680
ecosystem you use people who have uh you

1287
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,680
know amas and all of those of the world

1288
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,880
who have that infrastructure and you

1289
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:13,119
sign up with them no cost no fixed

1290
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,319
cost so it depends on the amount of

1291
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:17,040
space that you sign up for is you're

1292
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,799
using and then it it starts from there

1293
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,319
for the first 6 months of our business

1294
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:24,520
we did not have an office a matter took

1295
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,760
one seat up I think you can transfer the

1296
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:29,400
question sush she this hot food he knows

1297
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,359
that I ate before I came what year was

1298
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,960
this we started we launched Mama Earth

1299
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,799
in December of

1300
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:39,839
2016 so

1301
00:54:39,839 --> 00:54:43,640
2015 um end of 2015 and early 2016 is

1302
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,680
when we were figuring it out July is

1303
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,160
when we incorporated the company we then

1304
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,079
worked with Partners finding the right

1305
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,400
kind of people who could actually make

1306
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,799
it for us December 5th December 2016 is

1307
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:56,960
when we we launched it with Amazon

1308
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,680
Launchpad with uh what is Amazon

1309
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:02,359
Launchpad amaz Amazon launch pad okay so

1310
00:55:02,359 --> 00:55:04,319
that was also the first year that Amazon

1311
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,799
had come up with this property called

1312
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:07,920
Launchpad where they were helping

1313
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,559
startups or newer businesses get

1314
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,760
launched on their platform it was

1315
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,799
separate from Amazon so they were also

1316
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:16,960
trying to optimize for example these

1317
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,559
brands should come up and search or try

1318
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,160
to give them more visibility or get them

1319
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,880
um you know visibility to the right kind

1320
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,280
of people within the ecosystem of Amazon

1321
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,599
Etc so we launched with them you you

1322
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:31,280
would owe a lot of success to that pad

1323
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,240
that they created according to you now

1324
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,720
that was a starting point so you made a

1325
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,559
few products they worked what happened

1326
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,640
next you had a warehouse all of this

1327
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,400
costed in between also how how do you

1328
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:45,799
know the product worked or not worked

1329
00:55:45,799 --> 00:55:48,039
was also something that was really

1330
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:50,640
important and like completely changed

1331
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,520
the way we pitched the brand to our

1332
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,160
consumers or we talked about it um so we

1333
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,760
made those set of five products um

1334
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,599
because we were living in Delhi South

1335
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:03,240
Delhi really premium toy shopi and we

1336
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,319
stood outside that toy shop because that

1337
00:56:05,319 --> 00:56:06,880
guy did not let us in we wanted to do

1338
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,319
some consumer work to understand if

1339
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,599
people you went to a toy shop yeah he

1340
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:12,640
didn't let you in so you did s stood

1341
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,599
outside and did the survey and anybody

1342
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:17,160
can do that anybody can do that it it's

1343
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,079
basically a walkway outside the shops

1344
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:21,000
right anybody can stand there so we

1345
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,440
stood there we knew our relevant

1346
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,400
consumer set is going to come and

1347
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,799
parents are the only ones who will come

1348
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,240
to a toy shop or probably one who's

1349
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,640
trying to take a gift for kids but they

1350
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,760
will be exposed to that segment of kids

1351
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,160
right so we stood there um

1352
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,599
andly approached people who were working

1353
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,559
in made them try our products for

1354
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:48,359
feedback gave them candies in return

1355
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:49,680
that was the only thing that we could

1356
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,280
afford back then um and started filling

1357
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,039
our survey form for us to be able to

1358
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,799
take feedback because when you're making

1359
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,319
natural

1360
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,599
products back then we did not know that

1361
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:02,880
the performance can be at par with some

1362
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,640
of these other products now we know far

1363
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,280
better but we also thought that

1364
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,000
performance might not be as good or the

1365
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,520
texture might not be as good it's a

1366
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,440
handmade batch Etc we wanted to take a

1367
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,799
lot of feedback on the way the product

1368
00:57:13,799 --> 00:57:16,480
looked we had created labels so you were

1369
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,119
doing it with the packaging as well yeah

1370
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:19,760
and we had created the labels and

1371
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,680
everything at home B waren and I came up

1372
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,920
with the brand name those labels still

1373
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,520
continue all our baby products are with

1374
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,520
the same label that we had designed back

1375
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,079
then uh and you got this far with no

1376
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:36,000
money very little money yeah so we had

1377
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,680
raised a friends and family around

1378
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,559
because we thought we would need a lot

1379
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:42,440
of money MH uh we we did need money so

1380
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,200
for example the entire first 30 days it

1381
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,359
was just me and waren when we launched

1382
00:57:48,359 --> 00:57:50,280
ourselves on Amazon Launchpad and a few

1383
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,839
orders started coming in we were the

1384
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:53,000
ones who were packing the orders

1385
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,880
ourselves as well for us to be able to

1386
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,720
to dispatch it I still remember December

1387
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,200
is when we got this order of uh 20 sets

1388
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:05,520
of four different products from Bombay

1389
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,960
this mother wanted to give those

1390
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,200
products as return gifts on a birthday

1391
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:14,799
party and we were like super happy very

1392
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,799
excited but so nervous Beast product per

1393
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:21,039
you working with five per product how

1394
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,400
would we make it how would the

1395
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,960
production happen who will make it how

1396
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,839
will it get reach them in time etc etc

1397
00:58:26,839 --> 00:58:29,160
but figured figured that piece out

1398
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,039
worked on crunch timelines and

1399
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:34,160
everything um January the first time you

1400
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,000
get that check for the first transaction

1401
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,920
it's like is the most special the first

1402
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,400
purchase the first consumer the first

1403
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,119
bulk

1404
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,880
order BR it's the most special it is it

1405
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,960
was really special and that's when

1406
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,119
that's what gave us confidence that we

1407
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:53,400
feel we need somebody in the team the

1408
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,920
first check framed at our office the

1409
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,520
first check of like bulk booking of 10

1410
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,039
room nights so you pitched each vendor

1411
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:03,559
individually to get orders yes and how

1412
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:06,039
do you find out who the vendor should be

1413
00:59:06,039 --> 00:59:09,079
for Cosmetics or baby products no back

1414
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:10,359
then I didn't have an option there was

1415
00:59:10,359 --> 00:59:12,319
only one guy who said yes okay I'll work

1416
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:13,920
with you how did you find who to pitch

1417
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,680
to so okay the way you find

1418
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,880
manufacturing there are so many personal

1419
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,599
care products available in the market

1420
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,680
every personal care product has the

1421
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,240
manufacturer's address written on it

1422
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:27,839
right so you pick up like the to yeah

1423
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,200
you pick up top 10 you reach out to them

1424
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,160
for them to give you some time for you

1425
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,720
to be able to go to them and Pitch

1426
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:36,039
nobody gave us time these were the only

1427
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,000
people that we were able to get through

1428
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,680
we had a conversation with them um we

1429
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,319
loved the fact that they were parents

1430
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:43,799
themselves and that gave us a lot of

1431
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:45,640
confidence that they will put an extra

1432
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:48,240
effort to figure this out with us which

1433
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:50,319
they did uh so they came in as a

1434
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,400
blessing to us um so started working all

1435
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,920
the products were being manufactured at

1436
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:57,039
the same place as a consumer it's

1437
00:59:57,039 --> 00:59:59,599
actually the most misunderstood thing is

1438
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,760
it yeah yeah one of the biggest pain

1439
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,000
points that I'm facing today uh is this

1440
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,359
perception that people have that if

1441
01:00:08,359 --> 01:00:10,079
you're manufacturing if you don't have

1442
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,720
your own manufacturing the quality of

1443
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,880
the product can't be as good who is it

1444
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,599
because you don't have they subcontract

1445
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,160
everything right so technically they do

1446
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,000
but it's not really but isn't that the

1447
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,119
case with most large not manufactured by

1448
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,520
Mama right it's it's uh sold and

1449
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,000
marketed by m and then manufactur that

1450
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,200
true for most large cpg companies

1451
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:34,640
they see what I think consumers will say

1452
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,480
for the long and this comes from history

1453
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,880
right for the longest period of time for

1454
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:40,839
example H Etc all of these larger

1455
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:42,039
Partners have had their own

1456
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,079
manufacturing for that matter 10 years

1457
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,640
back that was the only way to get into

1458
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:48,200
business you can produce a product if

1459
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,079
you have a manufacturing unit and that

1460
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,960
was the capex that was required to set

1461
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,760
it up to get started I'm so glad that

1462
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,400
that entire process got disrupted and

1463
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,640
with very minimal Capital you can now

1464
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,799
use this Shar infrastructure and start a

1465
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:06,839
business of your own otherwise like 90%

1466
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:08,720
of the ideas would have still stayed an

1467
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,799
idea because you didn't have the money

1468
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,920
now from the consumer side because this

1469
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,119
comes to me a lot personally that you

1470
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:20,240
don't have your own manufacturing and

1471
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:22,480
hence what they don't understand is

1472
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,599
manufacturing is different R&D is

1473
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:26,440
different the IP is

1474
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,640
developing Personal Care there's no IP

1475
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,960
there's no IP right because you are

1476
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,280
you're disclosing 100% of the

1477
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,200
ingredients ingredients with the

1478
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,400
percentages so not with the percentages

1479
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,480
but you're disclosing the name when R&D

1480
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,280
is yours which is and a product has so

1481
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,480
much to it the the sensorial the texture

1482
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,599
the efficacy the feel that just knowing

1483
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:48,359
the knowing the ingredients you might be

1484
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:49,960
able to come closer to the product but

1485
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:52,640
you cannot crack exactly what the other

1486
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:55,039
person has cracked right uh or you

1487
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,359
reverse engineer that's also a

1488
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:01,839
possibility but a company can have it

1489
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:04,599
her own R&D her own

1490
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:07,760
expertise we have our team members

1491
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,920
sitting at manufacturers plant you know

1492
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,599
to to to for Quality checks to ensure

1493
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:15,079
that everything that we have set out as

1494
01:02:15,079 --> 01:02:17,480
a process is being followed and what we

1495
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,720
are using is the capex that that person

1496
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,480
has invested into putting those machines

1497
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,440
and setting up that manufacturing unit

1498
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,440
if I have to set it up today it actually

1499
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,279
becomes a limitation for my business

1500
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:29,079
because I'll be limited with the space

1501
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:31,200
that I have the number of machines that

1502
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,760
I can put and hence Innovation which for

1503
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,640
the longest period of time has been

1504
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,920
super slow in India formulations get

1505
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,359
developed outside of India and then they

1506
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,640
are imported within India and then

1507
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:43,240
they're adjusted for India which dilutes

1508
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:46,039
the performance of the product that is

1509
01:02:46,039 --> 01:02:48,680
something which Mama challenged that is

1510
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,319
something that we figured and we played

1511
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,640
on and Innovation is an edge now that

1512
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,960
everybody talks about about and all of

1513
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:56,640
the larger players have also started

1514
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,200
talking about it okay coming back to it

1515
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,599
so as a 21 year-old uh what I have

1516
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:03,319
learned

1517
01:03:03,319 --> 01:03:06,359
today if I'm able to look at a great

1518
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:09,760
Korean brand I know the formulation I

1519
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,640
can hit people up on LinkedIn who will

1520
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,720
make it for me I can find a lab which

1521
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,839
will be willing to do five to 10 pieces

1522
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,279
to try if I convince them enough yeah at

1523
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:25,920
a negligible cost I don't really need to

1524
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,279
spend the money required to set up a

1525
01:03:28,279 --> 01:03:30,599
manufacturing facility yes I can use a

1526
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,039
co-packer and it'll just be be just as

1527
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:35,480
good probably better because if one guy

1528
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:37,440
is not doing good I can make him compete

1529
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,319
with another and get a better

1530
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:43,119
product now I've gotten to the point

1531
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,960
where I can manufacture how do I get

1532
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,359
distribution how do I sell what worked

1533
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:49,119
for Mama

1534
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,680
there so when we were doing the consumer

1535
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,960
study sitt standing outside that toy

1536
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,520
shop we realized we got a lot of

1537
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,119
feedback on how to communicate what to

1538
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,000
communicate what was what were they

1539
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,200
understanding what were they not

1540
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:05,799
understanding so one of the examples a

1541
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:08,119
pack said sulfate free and this one

1542
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:10,720
mother came to us and said sulfate free

1543
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,200
free so that was the understanding that

1544
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,680
the consumer had and we realized that

1545
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,559
just communicating this free that

1546
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:19,079
ingredients this is free of these

1547
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:21,160
harmful ingredients is how we've got to

1548
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,200
put it we can't say sulfate free paraben

1549
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,079
free communication got sorted from there

1550
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,799
what we also realized was that for a new

1551
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:31,880
brand purchasing from directly from the

1552
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,400
website takes some time for them to have

1553
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,640
trust on the product or the brand and

1554
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,440
hence platforms which have which these

1555
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,319
guys already trust which were like

1556
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:46,799
Amazon Amazon flip cart Etc it's better

1557
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,279
to list yourself there and be available

1558
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:52,640
there because the Trust on the platform

1559
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,640
has an equity rub off on your brand that

1560
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,920
if this brand is available on the

1561
01:04:56,920 --> 01:04:59,240
platform that I trust yes I would want

1562
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:02,240
to give it a try what works in terms of

1563
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,200
like you said not sulfate free or

1564
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,720
paraben free but different things that

1565
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,440
was your hack what could be a hack in

1566
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,680
the ecosystem today 21 yearold starting

1567
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,760
a Cosmetic Company what can I what can I

1568
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,160
use as a means of selling my product

1569
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,839
which would be differentiation today it

1570
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,480
depends on different propositions for

1571
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,839
example mama was one brand we now have

1572
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,079
six Brands and each brand has a very

1573
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:30,760
different communication and a very

1574
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,760
different proposition Beauty and

1575
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,680
personal care in India is still evolving

1576
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,760
right um there and people now have

1577
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,520
Global aspirations they know what's

1578
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,839
happening in a Korea they know what's

1579
01:05:40,839 --> 01:05:42,279
happening in a China and how the beauty

1580
01:05:42,279 --> 01:05:43,559
system there is can I bring what's

1581
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:44,920
happening in Korea to India and

1582
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,839
replicate it well and it's an

1583
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:49,640
opportunity right now you can bring

1584
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:51,839
what's happening in Korea to India one

1585
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,319
way is you Source the products from

1586
01:05:53,319 --> 01:05:55,599
there and make it available in India at

1587
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:56,839
affordable prices and you'll have to

1588
01:05:56,839 --> 01:05:58,559
figure people are already doing that

1589
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,760
well right yeah but it ends up being

1590
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,520
expensive second is you create your own

1591
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,240
brand on the proposition that's working

1592
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,640
there because you've checked enough that

1593
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:10,160
even Indian consumers really very

1594
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,000
strongly relate with it so I'll give you

1595
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,559
an example can we match Korean quality

1596
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,160
here you can do better nice I've done

1597
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,119
that with my third brand good to hear I

1598
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:21,920
have a brand called aqualog which is a

1599
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,240
brand based on deep hydration for your

1600
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,559
skin Korea skincare trend is deep

1601
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,880
hydration for your skin they've been

1602
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,559
using multiple ingredients to figure

1603
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,760
those formulations out we said what can

1604
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,760
we do for India see the problem is for

1605
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,480
the longest period of Time beauty

1606
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,000
Personal Care

1607
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:44,880
industry it was like says it

1608
01:06:47,559 --> 01:06:51,680
beautifully charm right people haven't

1609
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:54,440
been able to come out of it and say that

1610
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:56,240
Indian skin is different Indian weather

1611
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,880
is different and hence the product

1612
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,039
efficacy or the product texture Etc

1613
01:07:00,039 --> 01:07:02,799
needs to be different um so aqualog is

1614
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,279
that brand which is based on basically

1615
01:07:05,279 --> 01:07:07,279
this Korean Trend around deep hydration

1616
01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:09,880
for your skin um a bestselling product

market by

1619

storm it is the best selling sunen with

1620
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,960
hydration sunscreen with hydration no

1621
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,480
white hydration G I like I know what a

1622
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:24,520
moisturizer is but how does it like I'm

1623
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:26,079
actually curious about a lot of what

1624
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:28,559
you're saying and I'm

1625
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,319
like what determines how much hydration

1626
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:35,000
you get from what

1627
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,079
cream so one like if I'm paying a bomb

1628
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,839
like if I'm paying one lak rupees for a

1629
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:42,839
fancy cream let's say laam mer or

1630
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:45,119
something and let's say I'm paying 200

1631
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,240
rupees or 50 rupees for a cheap cream

1632
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,359
let me not name them yeah what is the

1633
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:53,559
difference so one the way your skin

1634
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:56,359
feels after 2 to 3 hours of application

1635
01:07:56,359 --> 01:07:58,119
or even after 6 to 8 hours of

1636
01:07:58,119 --> 01:07:59,880
application should one tell you the

1637
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,799
difference second we have figured so

1638
01:08:03,799 --> 01:08:06,960
simple hack Amazon has this instrument

1639
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,279
called moisture meter I think it's

1640
01:08:09,279 --> 01:08:11,440
available anywhere between 3 to 400

1641
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,520
bucks that's it right apply any cream

1642
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,439
test the moisture in your skin compare

1643
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:20,359
whatever creams you want to compare and

1644
01:08:20,359 --> 01:08:21,839
it'll tell you which cream is the most

1645
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,520
hydrating one over the years I've

1646
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:25,679
realized nothing should be left to gut

1647
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,359
based or subjective interpretation of

1648
01:08:28,359 --> 01:08:30,799
things if you put in can buy this on

1649
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:33,560
Amazon yes yes but what's the meter we

1650
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,399
should look for that it is correct so it

1651
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:38,439
has two uh metrics moisture content and

1652
01:08:38,439 --> 01:08:40,560
oil content oil content needs to be

1653
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,719
lesser moisture content needs to be

1654
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:44,679
higher the more moisturizing it is the

1655
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:46,319
more moisture content the more hydrating

1656
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,560
the product is if the oil content also

1657
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,640
ends up being higher you will feel

1658
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,279
stickiness on your skin and that's how

1659
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:55,040
you can judge the I won't get into

1660
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,719
distribution too much CU we did a

1661
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:59,719
episode with Kishore Raj and anant and

1662
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:02,439
we did distribution for two hours how to

1663
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:05,399
sell on Amazon how to be ranked higher

1664
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:08,000
in their algorithm growth hack stuff

1665
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,759
like that but incredible story uh some

1666
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:14,600
of the Nuance I don't know like now will

1667
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,439
be resonate with it when you were 12 13

1668
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:22,279
years old the split in your

1669
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:25,600
family built some kind of insecurity in

1670
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,439
you

1671
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:29,880
that many of the other

1672
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:34,198
things loyalty Financial Freedom Early

1673
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:37,520
slightly aggressive slightly

1674
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:40,439
unforgiving uh forget but don't truly

1675
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:42,679
forget forgiving but don't doesn't

1676
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,560
forget forgive I've forgiven a lot of

1677
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:47,759
people in my life could you say that if

1678
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:50,279
you forgive and you don't forget is

1679
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:52,679
slightly unforgiving true no true

1680
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:54,440
forgiveness for

1681
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:57,480
you're putting yourself at ease you're

1682
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,840
taking that burden or that pressure off

1683
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,040
your otherwise it keeps moving in your

1684
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,800
mind that you're still upset by certain

1685
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,920
things so you've forgiven it's no longer

1686
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,800
bothering you and it's no longer

1687
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:13,760
bothering the other person but would I

1688
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:15,920
trust that person again with the amount

1689
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,719
of trust that I had before would I trust

1690
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:20,280
that person again probably yes but with

1691
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:22,960
my share with my fair share of doubts

1692
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,719
yeah uh mom stepping up big event yes it

1693
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:31,159
it's very evident how that has uh also

1694
01:10:31,159 --> 01:10:33,440
when you said Mom or Dad favorite or who

1695
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,400
you would like to be like you said Mom I

1696
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,199
think it has defined your personality to

1697
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:38,560
a certain

1698
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,760
extent uh when you got confident about

1699
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,920
how you look beyond the 12th grade I

1700
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,880
think retesh came in between and added

1701
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:51,280
there but being confident about

1702
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,000
anything uh how you are conf confident

1703
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,600
about how you look is a big part of

1704
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,760
being confident about anything yes and I

1705
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,640
think to any young entrepreneur it makes

1706
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:01,080
a big

1707
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:04,800
difference also uh creativity by virtue

1708
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,120
of being an artist big part of I'm

1709
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,159
drawing a guzzle word cloud M at the end

1710
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:12,239
of the day I will compare word clouds

1711
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:14,280
because you are anomalies all three of

1712
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,239
you one in 99 who have failed at

1713
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,080
building a successful startup so I'll

1714
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,400
see what are the

1715
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,640
similarities and then we will try and

1716
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,520
fig out if this is the right answer to

1717
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:28,960
the question what makes a startup

1718
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,360
successful creativity again I think

1719
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:33,920
extremely important in a world where

1720
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:35,840
everything has become so

1721
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,159
mechanized uh differentiation comes from

1722
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:41,280
creativity uh and this is a little bit

1723
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,320
of a digression but how good your

1724
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,960
partner

1725
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,520
is

1726
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,679
yes how you how

1727
01:11:50,679 --> 01:11:53,320
supportive the man or woman you choose

1728
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:57,440
to to uh cohabitate with or marry or

1729
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,719
have children with absolutely is a game

1730
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:01,920
changer absolutely would you think this

1731
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,800
would have been your word cloud starting

1732
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:06,280
off what is guzzle the

1733
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:08,360
entrepreneur very interesting I'm also

1734
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,719
hearing this for the first time I've

1735
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:12,719
never created yeah I've never created a

1736
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,880
word cloud around me but um I would

1737
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:19,560
truly say these are the words that have

1738
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,760
i I can't add anything more to it these

1739
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:24,600
are the largest defining pillars of your

1740
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:27,159
professional success yes and not the

1741
01:12:27,159 --> 01:12:29,000
typical hardworking generic

1742
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,520
that everybody gives right those are by

1743
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,000
products that everybody needs to have

1744
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,760
yeah like over the time I also figured

1745
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:38,159
that everything is f figureoutable is

1746
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:41,320
the word that I use but I mean there's

1747
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,120
nothing that you can't figure if you if

1748
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:45,920
you put in the right amount of effort

1749
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,600
everything in the world is figureoutable

1750
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,800
it's it doesn't matter like you've

1751
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:51,239
learned it you've done a course around

1752
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:54,120
it You' you've picked this up or not

1753
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,239
just to be curious enough and that works

1754
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,600
really well but thank you for being so

1755
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:01,239
vulnerable and honest about it I think

1756
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:04,719
uh in this pursuit of being more public

1757
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,760
we all become so rehearsed with time

1758
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,960
that we become boring and I think people

1759
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,800
are able to gauge that today I'm sure

1760
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:18,520
yeah I'm sure yeah okay moving on I

1761
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,360
think we'll come to rates last because

1762
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:24,159
his story is most popular and has been

1763
01:13:24,159 --> 01:13:28,159
told so many times so Manish is this

1764
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:30,480
rare like you know we talk so much in

1765
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:32,440
the media about unicorns and all that

1766
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:35,120
right I don't know what animal is rarer

1767
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,400
than unicorns I would call him like I

1768
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,320
don't know a dinosaur dinosaur I was

1769
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,880
going to say dinosaur because that one

1770
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,960
is rarer yeah so you made my cloud

1771
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,520
already yeah the one word is

1772
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,040
enough so I've seen rare rabbit uh

1773
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,000
there's a store in the mall right next

1774
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
to my house uh in UB City and I've seen

1775
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,639
it like here and there many times in the

1776
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:02,800
past so we were investing or we're in

1777
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,600
the process of investing in rare rabbit

1778
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,040
and when we started researching the

1779
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,120
company a bit more it just didn't make

1780
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:15,960
sense it was stupidly incredible like a

1781
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,280
Indian H grown Western cloth

1782
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,840
manufacturer a company built in the era

1783
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,440
that we live live in making a profit

1784
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,159
after tax with no investors he it's his

1785
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:30,239
house so I'm hearing him fully bootstrap

1786
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:33,400
he's up uplifting it too much with no

1787
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:37,960
investors no dilution nobody and our man

1788
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,400
has built it when I when first

1789
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,400
generation you built it incredible how

1790
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,360
many years ago 7 years 7 years ago just

1791
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:49,120
7 years ago so we start congratulations

1792
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:52,280
2017 16 17 and nowhere to be found in

1793
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,360
the media no interviews no like if you

1794
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,520
you like our team was trying to do like

1795
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,400
a bio of him yeah someone asked bio I

1796
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,040
said he said he

1797
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,360

all that I was but you didn't pick it up

1815
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:04,920
like this mhm okay but I think uh India

1816
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:08,679
95% 98% normal this is

1817
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:12,440
like so we used to live there uh not had

1818
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,600
too much of access of great things from

1819
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,600
a color TV or whatever could go to

1820
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:20,000
neighbor's house to see movies uh they

1821
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,400
would be on sofa I would be on floor but

1822
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,120
that was life and uh there are a couple

1823
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:28,480
of things that strung me that when I

1824
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:31,120
moov from that place to Cuff parade

1825
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:33,920
which is the let's say the skyscraper

1826
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,600
part of Bombay because how old were you

1827
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,360
when your parents your dad and brother

1828
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,520
separated I would be

1829
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:43,719
what 3 four 5 years old 3 four month I

1830
01:16:43,719 --> 01:16:45,560
mean not even the conscious of mind too

1831
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:48,239
young to understand no we were in Bombay

1832
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:52,080
always actually that age they say

1833
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:56,040
between 3 to 78 all psychology states

1834
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:57,960
that even though your memories might not

1835
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,080
be Vivid those are the most impactful

1836
01:17:01,080 --> 01:17:03,560
those are very formative my memories go

1837
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,520
very grasp the most as like something I

1838
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,159
remember for some but I'm not sure this

1839
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,400
kind of stuff would they be able to

1840
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,480
understand yeah absolutely you would not

1841
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,960
understand what happened but now you can

1842
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,280
relate to it you can understand the

1843
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:17,360
noises you can understand that you're

1844
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,280
packing a bag and leaving and just going

1845
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,719
somewhere but yeah it happens in

1846
01:17:21,719 --> 01:17:23,880
everyone's life but

1847
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:26,400
I think uh we are sitting also here

1848
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,840
because today from whatever success

1849
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,760
we've got the message is also to those

1850
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,880
20 year olds that you may be in that

1851
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:36,679
same hustle buzle Madness wrongs and

1852
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:38,679
rights of life but there's always an

1853
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:40,280
outcome there's always a shine out

1854
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,280
that's why you can hear us or believe us

1855
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,800
or it can happen to any of you so moved

1856
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:49,960
uh it was tough uh small things were

1857
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,320
difficult I always had the eye for

1858
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,800
design color especially uh I can uh I

1859
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,360
can pick color very fast some eyes are

1860
01:17:58,360 --> 01:18:00,480
trained for that my God gift is

1861
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,159
that and uh I used to love shoes like

1862
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,040
these in those days and it was not

1863
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,199
accessible we'll put a picture of R's

1864
01:18:08,199 --> 01:18:10,480
shoe on his way out okay h on this

1865
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,239
podcast you should because really cool

1866
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,480
he's shying my red ones as well my sh my

1867
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,880
red ones are shying actually so for me

1868
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:21,280
it was a lot of everything was less

1869
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,679
available and I had to do a lot not too

1870
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:24,639
much in

1871
01:18:24,639 --> 01:18:28,040
advance uh right I mean everything in

1872
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,480
life I've done it I think almost 6 seven

1873
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,440
years earlier five six seven earlier

1874
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:36,239
from lighting a first cigarette to

1875
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:40,239
stealing Chiller money from home uh

1876
01:18:40,239 --> 01:18:42,199
stealing a car from the house doing

1877
01:18:42,199 --> 01:18:44,920
anything in life and then one fine day

1878
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,560
when you're growing you just say uh I

1879
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,880
the other big influencer of my life is

1880
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,639
movies uh Indian and uh the western

1881
01:18:52,639 --> 01:18:53,560
movies

1882
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,920
I think uh people may realize or not

1883
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,719
realize maybe some part you would

1884
01:18:57,719 --> 01:19:00,440
realize that in movies some some lady

1885
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:02,480
has also affected some personality there

1886
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,000
as well because Indian India

1887
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,639
is somewhat we are enveloped and

1888
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:09,480
surrounded with this this culture of

1889
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,480
movie around us actually I do I do and

1890
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,080
if you are now busy that's a different

1891
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:15,760
thing but it has a very big impact other

1892
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:18,280
than Parents movie and the role play has

1893
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:20,760
always I think the way diamonds and

1894
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,880
cigarettes got sold by Hollywood is test

1895
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:25,239
ment to yeah yeah how soft power is in

1896
01:19:25,239 --> 01:19:27,840
the movies absolutely but let's hear it

1897
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,719
from your childhood my childhood of

1898
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:34,719
course been uh unlike your parents uh my

1899
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:36,960
mother was very hard on me I was uh

1900
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:39,280
quite brutally handled because I was I

1901
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:41,120
also never gave get better reasons in

1902
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:45,040
life to her for doing everything in life

1903
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:47,880
and uh so I was talking about movies

1904
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:49,440
because uh with

1905
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,120
movies for me there was nothing Beyond

1906
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:55,080
methun chakra and amaban there was

1907
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,960
nothing there was one guy who could move

1908
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,159
dance and look Glamour and gold and this

1909
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:02,520
is this man who's got all this Charisma

1910
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,080
of looking how dashing he was and the

1911
01:20:05,080 --> 01:20:06,920
first time when the jacket came with a

1912
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:08,480
so we are talking about bomber jackets

1913
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,080
now when amaban got his first jacket to

1914
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:14,400
put his hands inside we were like how do

1915
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,320
you put a hand here you know that's

1916
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:19,159
that's a big thing there's a pocket here

1917
01:20:19,159 --> 01:20:20,800
and that was a big thing to have to

1918
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,880
ourselves that you could wear something

1919
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:24,280
I can have a pocket

1920
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,120
here so from dad's business would pick

1921
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,760
up some Fabrics here and there and uh

1922
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,639
from his office steal some T of Kaa and

1923
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:36,239
go to the tailor get it stitched sit

1924
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:39,199
there and as as and while this was

1925
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:43,120
happening uh uh education was nowhere

1926
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,320
just trying to uh kind of scrape through

1927
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:51,360
by 70% coping in exams and finding a way

1928
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:53,480
through just do this

1929
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:58,000
Duty and uh finally when 12th came I was

1930
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,360
done with the struggle of

1931
01:21:07,719 --> 01:21:09,960
copying just took a car back and I said

1932
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,719
Mom I don't want to study and I had this

1933
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:14,679
sag of becoming a businessman so in

and yeah to school and open my books

1937
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:24,600
from that and people would laugh at me

1938
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:25,800
because I just wanted to feel

01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,400

have certain sorts and my dad was very

1976
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,040
he was a very quick Rotator in business

1977
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:02,320
and unlike his brother who was 15 years

1978
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:05,520
older to him who would want to make more

1979
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,080
money but he would say you're making 25

1980
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,440
PES

1981
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,159
you so on that tussle he says no you

1982
01:23:14,159 --> 01:23:15,920
don't know business and he knows

1983
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,199
business better and things like that

1984
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,560
they split but he still went there to

1985
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:22,639
take that 20,000 m to the mill and and

1986
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:24,239
at that time

1987
01:23:24,239 --> 01:23:27,679
um he entered that office uh so he was

1988
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,520
not an English speaking guy he would

1989
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,159
actually go and he didn't know what

1990
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:33,520
excuse

1991
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,760
me he was just a straight man so he

1992
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:40,280
would enter the Chairman's office where

1993
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:42,239
he would have two guards and no one can

1994
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:44,920
get out of so Mr s when he would leave

1995
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:47,719
the textile mill who Mr s Mr shushil sen

1996
01:23:47,719 --> 01:23:49,920
is also one of the reason uh one of the

1997
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,040
the key man who made even Kish Ban's

1998
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,520
life and he also was instrumented making

1999
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:57,840
my Dad's life uh from very very early

2000
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,800
days what did he do uh uh Mr he was a

2001
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:02,679
director and chairman of all the mills

2002
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:05,280
in Bombay by the government in the ' 80s

2003
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:07,000
so when he would leave his house 42

2004
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,639
Mills air conditions used to go on

2005
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:15,960

2103
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,159
was the first one to actually create

2104
01:29:04,159 --> 01:29:06,560
mood boards which today in your business

2105
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,639
would be themes or the whole campaign

2106
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,040
board around and things like that I used

2107
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:12,440
to make those in these uh people would

2108
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:14,760
carry bags of swatches and hangers and I

2109
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,239
would carry boards unreal for even

2110
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:21,159
factories and uh self for Bangladesh uh

2111
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:23,360
not to even how old were you at this

2112
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:27,119
time 17 18 and not so when was the first

2113
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:29,480
paycheck you got on your own like a

2114
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,760
marvar family did you get paid by your

2115
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,600
family for a bit and then I so there's a

2116
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:38,600
very uh different and I hope the

2117
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:40,920
generation especially I don't know

2118
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:43,480
wherever it's relevant nowadays kids

2119
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:45,600
think you know ke dad has put me to

2120
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,600
education and uh one day I will pay back

2121
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,520
my dad for whatever he spent on my

2122
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:52,400
education and I tell my kids I said

2123
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:55,280
don't make it too cheap and shallow here

2124
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:57,480
you start from the birth from the cereal

2125
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,480
that you ate had even compounding B baj

2126
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,119
of Maris all the holidays and if you can

2127
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:05,679
also firstly calculate all that so don't

2128
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,520
take this short fouryear payout I

2129
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,400
thought that was a good thing I said I

2130
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,119
initially thought that you said you

2131
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:16,520
meant to say that don't be so shallow

2132
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,040
it's you don't need to do it and then

2133
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,840
you revers it and said Baba that starts

2134
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:22,440
all the way no I said no you do this

2135
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:24,719
because what's this this this fat

2136
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:26,080
because I have boys right and all of

2137
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,800
them are young and my friends have kids

2138
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,440
and they all have this one paycheck to

2139
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,119
the parent in the end like you know one

2140
01:30:32,119 --> 01:30:34,560
exit

2141
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:45,000
clause I said look I've employed people

2142
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,239
I've created a system and ecosystem

2143
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:49,679
you're born in this family not to give

2144
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,920
me my forc back and what do I do with

2145
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,600
that money you owe much more no and what

2146
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,760

2147
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,560
that you try to commit me that you'll

2148
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:00,840
add more value you'll do this you'll do

2149
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,760
that I want to dream this I want to go

01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:04,040
that's what you're supposed to do

2151
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,159
eventually would you want

2152
01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:08,719
your would they work at rare rabbit

2153
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:12,280
eventually uh I don't know this I so I

2154
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:14,440
work I think very differently my wife

2155
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,440
and I think very differently they have

2156
01:31:16,440 --> 01:31:18,320
their own life they can do what they

2157
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:21,119
want uh there is no ready seat at all

2158
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:24,239
they'll never get that readily why not

2159
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:26,080
because it's a business which has its

2160
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:29,040
own Dynamics it has its own plus minus 2

2161
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,480
plus 2 is never five four it's sometimes

2162
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,440
it's five sometimes it's minus for

2163
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,520
whatever reason because nothing works

2164
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,000
and you have to learn the the the sa CID

2165
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,800
kale you know you go up to 99 and

2166
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,440
suddenly like that last snake brings you

2167
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:44,560
down and you don't come up straight to

2168
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,119
100 because B Dial Dial R can I ask you

2169
01:31:48,119 --> 01:31:51,880
a question nurture versus nature who is

2170
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,920
is are kids predisposed to do well at a

2171
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,040
certain business is there a is there

2172
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,600
such a thing as Talent inherent talent

2173
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:03,199
in people or is it upbringing Evolution

2174
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:05,080
experience which defines who does well I

2175
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,199
think a small part of but it's a very

2176
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:10,320
small part to according to me that they

2177
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:14,239
they have it in them uh for whatever DNA

2178
01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:16,560
reason is just to be that you can have

2179
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:17,639
your

2180
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:22,560
uh somewhat a bit uh values of the

2181
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:25,600
family right that's it baky I think kids

2182
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,960
only see and become and behave uh only

2183
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,080
from whatever they see around their home

2184
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,800
uh dad's working hard he's coming late

2185
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:37,199
he's he's he's not he's still got a

2186
01:32:37,199 --> 01:32:39,520
smile on him and all of that so that

2187
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:41,080
upbringing the upbringing is not the

2188
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:42,719
upbringing you know holidays and take

2189
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:45,600
them out do some Trampoline Jumping and

2190
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,119
was that the case with your father he

2191
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:49,400
worked hard came home with a smile or no

2192
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:50,920
uh I never got to see my dad for the

2193
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,840
longest time he would come and I would

2194
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,320
be sleeping and uh Sunday was the only

2195
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,960
time and I would watch with him back

2196
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,560
toback four or five black and white

2197
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:02,199
movies for me when I was in textile uh I

2198
01:33:02,199 --> 01:33:04,520
used to I was very fortunate then uh at

2199
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:10,320
the age of 98 I was B 2021 and uh Dal G

2200
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,960
of century Mills which is owned by Mr BK

2201
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,960
Babu BK Bera wait what happened between

2202
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,239
18 to 21 that's where I am uh I got a

2203
01:33:19,239 --> 01:33:22,679
chance to uh so at 18 you split your

2204
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:25,159
brother your father and the other Uncle

2205
01:33:25,159 --> 01:33:28,040
who had not split split you left and

2206
01:33:28,040 --> 01:33:30,880
started what no no uh it was my dad who

2207
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:33,119
split with my uncle and I helped him

2208
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:35,480
that and that's why I was arbit I was an

2209
01:33:35,480 --> 01:33:37,119
arbitrator act actually at that time I

2210
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:38,960
was doing the my dad didn't want to he

2211
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,360
didn't understand what was going on and

2212
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:42,719
what's with the books and all of that

2213
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:45,679
and I had to dig in a lot so learned a

2214
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:47,239
lot actually from that I have no regrets

2215
01:33:47,239 --> 01:33:49,880
with that and I'm uh super super close

2216
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:52,199
to my family yet again

2217
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:55,480
and uh so we when we when we split I had

2218
01:33:55,480 --> 01:33:57,360
to start all over again took up

2219
01:33:57,360 --> 01:34:00,760
Bangladesh export business and uh what

2220
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,280
came my way because I got a little

2221
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,320
popular with the textile mills of morari

2222
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,159
Mills of pams why uh because I used to

2223
01:34:07,159 --> 01:34:10,239
be forever in their uh 60°

2224
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:13,760
furnace uh areas and inspecting fabrics

2225
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,239
and boiler rooms and no lunch I got

2226
01:34:18,239 --> 01:34:20,920
hospitalized for acidic attack no water

2227
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,719
intake that's my biggest habit wrong

2228
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:25,960
habit even today water is missing in my

2229
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,800
body when you talk about

2230
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:32,600
hydrants water itself has been it's been

2231
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,320
it's it's it's it's the the only bad

2232
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,719
habit I have I can't sip water even now

2233
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:41,760
I don't feel the urge of it but anyways

2234
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,880
uh moving from there got popularized and

2235
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:49,199
somehow Dal and panar in those days was

2236
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:50,639
this with your dad or outside with my

2237
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:53,360
dad uh yeah that's why I said I got my

2238
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,080
kids along because when you said is it

2239
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,800
your money and you separated or what is

2240
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,800
it I said dad had got this amount of

2241
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,920
uh uh three and a half four crores and

2242
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:05,719
big money back then yeah

2243
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:08,639
99 uh I would not so big I think it was

2244
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:11,520
good money it's not the bigs of today is

2245
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:14,119
like how you would imagine big is what

2246
01:35:14,119 --> 01:35:16,560
and

2247
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:22,320
uh so on and so forth so if you put that

2248
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:24,239
money in that frame then you realize

2249
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:27,280
you're already one only

2250
01:35:28,760 --> 01:35:31,800
left and then we finally said okay let

2251
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:36,280
me do this uh Mr Dalia of century Mills

2252
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:39,199
denim they put a plant in satti indor

2253
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:42,199
and they saw that they put the big large

2254
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:43,719
Mill and they didn't know how to make

2255
01:35:43,719 --> 01:35:46,920
more than 69 qualities there and I I

2256
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,760
could we and construct and so many other

2257
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,159
textures and beaves and I could take it

2258
01:35:51,159 --> 01:35:52,679
to almost

2259
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:56,320
450 uh 465 sort numbers they were sort

2260
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:58,239
numbers created like that they were each

2261
01:35:58,239 --> 01:36:00,600
quality batches and I would take about

2262
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,199
30 25 35% of the production to

2263
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:06,719
Bangladesh and sell it at a at a

2264
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:09,320
margin uh is that how Bangladesh's

2265
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,360
textile industry started so Bangladesh

2266
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,440
is a very it's a Jud country and uh so

2267
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,920
why would why would why did they have

2268
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,440
need or demand for the textile you were

2269
01:36:18,440 --> 01:36:21,760
taking from India to them so in 1986

2270
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,239
there is which is called the father of

2271
01:36:23,239 --> 01:36:27,679
the nation Mr nul kader he actually took

2272
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:30,800
16 men at his expense it's a very poor

2273
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:32,520
country was and back then though it was

2274
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:34,159
terrible now it's

2275
01:36:34,159 --> 01:36:37,080
booming that those numbers are the per

2276
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:39,000
capita income of Bangladesh is probably

2277
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,480
the highest in South Asia at least in

2278
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,159
textiles they've killed it right yeah

2279
01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:43,800
yeah but uh biggest employer in

2280
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:46,360
Bangladesh the lar indust largest in the

2281
01:36:46,360 --> 01:36:51,400
world and uh as a country and I think 56

2282
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:54,760
or 60% almost the GDP the economy is on

2283
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:57,440
garments to export manufactur garments

2284
01:36:57,440 --> 01:37:00,199
they employ the largest human force in

2285
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:03,639
uh in uh Manufacturing in one industry

2286
01:37:03,639 --> 01:37:06,800
alone so this gentleman Nal kin back in

2287
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,800
those days took 16 men and uh took them

2288
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:11,520
to Korea on his expense to understand

2289
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:15,480
how to do Line Manufacturing system not

2290
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:17,239
do one piece you he was the Prime

2291
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:20,239
Minister of no uh he was just a

2292
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:23,360
businessman uh but a very renowned

2293
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:26,119
person those 16 people from Korea when

2294
01:37:26,119 --> 01:37:27,800
they trained and came back it's like how

2295
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:29,679
the Toyota car manufacturing is Parts

2296
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:30,960
come from all sides and you're just

2297
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:33,679
assembling it so that's the mechanism of

2298
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:36,719
production which uh he adapted to on his

2299
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:39,360
expense he put up a large Factory huh

2300
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:43,280
and in 89 uh the entire Factory was

2301
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:47,119
underwater of 34 M so everyone had to

2302
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:49,119
leave he just took a promisory note in

2303
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:51,159
those days that you all will stick to

2304
01:37:51,159 --> 01:37:54,440
two garments so those 16 people became

2305
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:58,520
5,900 factories plus minus today in dhha

2306
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,360
and I think daa itself is the highest

2307
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,800
than it is Chong it's huge I mean they

2308
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:04,960
do the best of garment manufacturing

2309
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,920
globally today um so we I did very good

2310
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:09,560
business out of

2311
01:38:09,560 --> 01:38:12,679
Bangladesh of textile export uh

2312
01:38:12,679 --> 01:38:15,400
continuing whatever dad started in 88

2313
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:20,119
and from the age of 18 to to almost 23

2314
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:24,440
24 I got married at 24 and uh I was also

2315
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,480
doing South African textile export

2316
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,280
business and that's when I realized

2317
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:30,280
that's a smaller country I could ask or

2318
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:33,440
convince the brands like uh camel the

2319
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,639
cigarettes brand they had a

2320
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:36,320
manufacturing that bong and all of them

2321
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:37,840
that if I could manufacture garments and

2322
01:38:37,840 --> 01:38:40,960
send you so took the initial orders of 6

2323
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:45,239
800 pieces back in those days and uh was

2324
01:38:45,239 --> 01:38:48,280
doing well so what happened in

2325
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:52,360
2005 uh sorry yeah

2326
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:56,320
20045 uh I just was in Europe and I

2327

it's possible I can make it and

2332
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:10,119
everything was seeing made in Spain made

2333
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:14,800
in Spain so I thought Spain brand over

2334
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,719
G Apple Cola I mean

2335
01:39:17,719 --> 01:39:22,360

2339
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:33,159

2356
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:15,960

2381
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:19,280

2382
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,599
it while he's talking to me in a meeting

2383
01:41:21,599 --> 01:41:24,599
room and they have 200 meeting rooms uh

2384
01:41:24,599 --> 01:41:27,599
each table is as big as this and 600 ft

2385
01:41:27,599 --> 01:41:28,280

01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,320
room 200 meeting rooms and you have

2387
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:33,760
Korea China but tell me what are the

2388
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,719
odds if I like I'm making t-shirt

2389
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:39,320
there's my t-shirt I call Zara and say

2390
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,440
will you buy my t-shirt what are the

2391
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,040
odds of them buying

2392
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:45,440
it so if I look at this particular

2393
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:46,719
t-shirt because you've written the word

2394
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:48,800
Bangalore boy and if the designer there

2395
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,360
or the chief designer there or someone

2396
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:51,840
just catches is an eye and a story

2397
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:54,119
behind it that I'm taking a city which

2398
01:41:54,119 --> 01:41:57,040
they'll not take a city uh no sorry they

2399
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,400
will take it they'll not take uh scripts

2400
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:00,800
of different language because it could

2401
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,520
mean an abuse there here and all that so

2402
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,320
if they can build City Tokyo New York

2403
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:07,040
Bangalore if they create a table of

2404
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:08,760
t-shirts if that's the theme they would

2405
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:12,159
have they would place an order to you uh

2406
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:14,679

01:42:14,679 --> 01:42:17,040

2412
01:42:25,480 --> 01:42:28,000
fine in those days I worked for 12 years

2413
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:29,920
exclusively for them I designed

2414
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:31,880
collections for them I was the only

2415
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:35,239
men's manufacturer for them for uh Zara

2416
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:37,520
man and uh when you say you were the

2417
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,480
only men's manufacturer you're talking

2418
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:41,360
about all of and designing so it used I

2419
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:43,119
used to sell my own design I'm not a

2420
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:45,599
factory who would who would

2421
01:42:45,599 --> 01:42:47,719
manufacture given

2422
01:42:47,719 --> 01:42:49,880
designs which most of the exporters do

2423
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,199
in India so Zara gives them a design and

2424
01:42:52,199 --> 01:42:54,719
says make this for us yeah that's it you

2425
01:42:54,719 --> 01:42:56,520
would design and take it to Zara and say

2426
01:42:56,520 --> 01:42:58,280
show a collection sell the collection

2427
01:42:58,280 --> 01:43:02,159
and and get my hit ratio there so of

2428
01:43:02,159 --> 01:43:03,760
course coming back it's still about that

2429
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,840
marble no and uh I always did business

2430
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:09,080
for only profit I never understood

2431
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:11,400
business which had no margin similar

2432
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:14,320
what your dad said

2433
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:23,000
that I don't know because I only knew 2

2434
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,880
plus 2 has to be four or 2 plus 2 make

2435
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,480
me my six because I need that balance

2436
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,719
too so I didn't know any other formula

2437
01:43:29,719 --> 01:43:31,480
and that similar thing happened with Ray

2438
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:33,719
rabbit as well when my dad came once to

2439
01:43:33,719 --> 01:43:35,400
see the collection and he said this boy

2440
01:43:35,400 --> 01:43:38,360
is getting frustrated doing exports so

2441
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:40,599
in that whole process of my life because

2442
01:43:40,599 --> 01:43:43,760
25 you went to Zara 12 years you made

2443
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:47,320
t-shirts for Zara you were 37 by then

2444
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,560
yeah and then what happened and became

2445
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:51,760
the largest for the kids where started

2446
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,360
mango what is the scale of this how much

2447
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,159
money did you make from Zara at that

2448
01:43:55,159 --> 01:43:57,520
point I'll tell you about my first money

2449
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:59,040
then what you're talking about my first

2450
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,199
Money Was

2451
01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:03,080
Bangladesh uh which was

2452
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:07,280
uh on calculation it was about 25 lakhs

2453
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,840
and I I placed the order in I got an

2454
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,159
order from Bangladesh you're talking

2455
01:44:11,159 --> 01:44:13,520
about one order one order and when I

2456
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:16,520
took that order I had to go to salm to

2457
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:19,560
place it and uh I stayed back in salm

2458
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:20,800
because I found that I could not I

2459
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:23,199
should not buy from traders in Bombay

2460
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,080
and when I went to Salem I could find it

2461
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,560
at least 15 10 Rupees cheaper because he

2462
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,040
was keeping that margin so I stayed back

2463
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,520
there and I opened an office there and

2464
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,080
only I did come back to

2465
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:36,719
Bombay and uh a lot of mosquitoes so I

2466
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,960
would sleep with a wet towel on me

2467
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,000
because the the building that I bought

2468
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,560
now rent has

2469
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,599
started but it was a bad choice today if

2470
01:44:47,599 --> 01:44:49,599
you ask me because I didn't know what

2471
01:44:49,599 --> 01:44:50,679
sound I was sleeping with with

2472
01:44:50,679 --> 01:44:54,000
mosquitoes of what size and it was bad

2473
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,840
and uh so that my first real income was

2474
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:59,040
25 lakhs and to that same customer

2475
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,119
within 3 months I paid 50 lakhs as claim

2476
01:45:02,119 --> 01:45:03,440
because that quality which was shipped

2477
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,440
from there was not of good

2478
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:08,880
standard and I was crying uh from the

2479
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,159
hotel there and I called up

2480
01:45:12,159 --> 01:45:15,440
Dad and the only thing he explained me

2481
01:45:15,440 --> 01:45:16,880
was

2482
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:19,159
that my dad never knew which class I am

2483
01:45:19,159 --> 01:45:21,440
in all his life

2484
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,719
and I

2485
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:39,599
said I'm

2486
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:42,679

going the right way and I'm very uh the

2523
01:47:45,159 --> 01:47:47,679
way I walked up to you I do that and ask

2524
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:49,480
if I if I find that I can get some

2525
01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:50,639
answer from him I'll take him in the

2526
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:52,840

flexible good way better way to put it

2531
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:07,599

2532
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:19,520
yeah you are showing that you are ready

2533
01:48:19,520 --> 01:48:21,679
to bend your ego is

2534
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:27,719
low and uh yeah so that's textile for me

2535
01:48:27,719 --> 01:48:30,000
and garments

2536
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,159
was did so well that I didn't even know

2537
01:48:33,159 --> 01:48:35,560
how to cost garment so if you're in Zara

2538
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,320
and I had so my first collection I did

2539
01:48:37,320 --> 01:48:41,280
is I took some Fabrics from hind ma

2540
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,840
theater

2541
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:46,159
ladies all these chicken Fabrics in bomb

2542
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:47,800
Bombay just picked up anything filled a

2543
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:50,599
car went to Davi did some some block

2544
01:48:50,599 --> 01:48:53,800
printing on it for Zara made some shirts

2545
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,320
no I just first made it then I called

2546
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:56,800
them up and I went and showed them they

2547
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,880
were like stun I said it's a temple That

2548
01:48:59,880 --> 01:49:02,880
Jag it's a mad place you know they have

2549
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:04,679
a very simple

2550
01:49:04,679 --> 01:49:06,880
philosophy in the

2551
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:09,159
company someone's coming from China it

2552
01:49:09,159 --> 01:49:11,480
takes him 24 hours to come here someone

2553
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:13,480
from India takes 18 hours 16 hours to

2554
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:14,880
come come here because there's no direct

2555
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,520
flight to span a so everybody's ready to

2556
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:21,360
come here and show them this F with that

2557
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,760
work on it right you designers cannot

2558
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,119
dream that okay we've got the papis to

2559
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,520
release whatever is shot in Milan and

2560
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:32,520
all of that because now the phones are

2561
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:34,880
your freedom of speech earlier they had

2562
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:37,400
to be like those kind of thing and those

2563
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:40,320
are paid guys who give the images out

2564
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,159
and

2565
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:45,880
uh so they cannot refuse somebody and

2566
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:47,920
why do you think is that because he's

2567
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:49,280
coming he's taking the trouble to come

2568
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:51,719
and show you a bag of 4,500

2569
01:49:51,719 --> 01:49:53,760
garments I'll relate it to you if

2570
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:55,400
someone is coming in from Korea to show

2571
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:59,040
you design of bottles every week five

2572
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,560
times five new guys are coming and

2573
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,159
showing you bottles of

2574
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:04,400
designs why would you even dream of

2575
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:05,280
saying

2576
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,320
no why would you even create a a great

2577
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:10,040
great C why would you create a wall in

2578
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:12,480
your office

2579
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:14,800
saying

2580
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:17,119
exactly that's

2581
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:20,400
the then why what else is to learn from

2582
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:24,040
um index one learning you mentioned is

2583
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:27,560
uh no meetings can be refused I take

2584
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:30,360
unregistered numbers I take it because I

2585
01:50:30,360 --> 01:50:31,960
just think someday a vendor is calling

2586
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:34,639
me and they

2587
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:37,599
said I

2588
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:41,520
said their logic is very simple okay U

2589
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:44,159
this has got a skewed tailored pocket

2590
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:47,360
it's done by hand this can't be stitched

2591
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:50,040
the designer has to find this and he has

2592
01:50:50,040 --> 01:50:51,440
has to listen that the Japanese guy is

2593
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:55,199
saying something and he has to take it

2594
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:57,360
back and you do what you want to do

2595
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:59,639
behind so my shirts would go like they

2596
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:03,079
made they have a 100,000 ft showroom in

2597
01:51:03,079 --> 01:51:06,520
the office blank white like a clinic

2598
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,840
like a lab and they're building the

2599
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:10,920
collection for the next season which is

2600
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:13,920
9 months later so they come and they say

2601
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,760
okay we thinking about these city name

2602
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:17,679
boys and Graphics someone has thought

2603
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:20,119
we've built a board and luckily he comes

2604
01:51:20,119 --> 01:51:21,280
with this t-shirt and I go with this

2605
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:24,000
t-shirt I go down to the it's a closed

2606
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,440
private area oh it fits well come back

2607
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,840
and while they're walking up only they

2608
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,239
re Russia okay Europe fine us done

2609
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:38,440
40,000 pieces one color done no

2610
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,840
PO you pack your bag you leave you start

2611
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,280
production while while you sit in the

2612
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,639
car you've already started taking the

2613
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:47,719
Yar booking closing I'm I'm loving this

2614
01:51:47,719 --> 01:51:50,079
and and they're very fast and that's why

2615
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:51,800
probably they are the most Innovative

2616
01:51:51,800 --> 01:51:53,520
and they are able to turn things around

2617
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:55,079
and bring the best spe their speed is

2618
01:51:55,079 --> 01:51:58,119
simple that we are not creating bombs

2619
01:51:58,119 --> 01:52:00,239
there's no mistake here that red and red

2620
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:01,840
wire got connected to the yellowed will

2621
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:03,960
explode whereas you talk about the

2622
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:06,360
American businesses of Brands and

2623
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:08,560
everything their Sops and their

2624
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,960
methodology their books their Bible they

2625
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,079
give you to read Zara never inspected my

2626
01:52:14,079 --> 01:52:16,480
factory for 12 years they never even

2627
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:18,520
visited where I am and when they give

2628
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:20,159
you a order and I asked them once that

2629
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:22,040
what if you don't get your shipment on

2630
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:24,560
time so that's your loss you lost

2631
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:26,920
business from index so trust is also

2632
01:52:26,920 --> 01:52:29,000
another very key part of their you lost

2633
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,199
index and your blue didn't come now

2634
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:32,520
we've already bought three times more

2635
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:34,440
because we already know some shipment

2636
01:52:34,440 --> 01:52:37,000
gets cancelled some flood happens some

2637
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,199
political crisis ship has not comeing

2638
01:52:39,199 --> 01:52:41,639
over our time and we have a wall to

2639
01:52:41,639 --> 01:52:43,679
create of all these pieces on your wall

2640
01:52:43,679 --> 01:52:45,400
that you see has to come at one time in

2641
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:47,159
the store that's and when they give you

2642
01:52:47,159 --> 01:52:49,520
an order for 40,000 pieces do they pay

2643
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:52,000
up from FR nothing

2644
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,960
nothing and 90 days so the credit line

2645
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:57,199
in our business is 90 days so if you

2646
01:52:57,199 --> 01:52:59,920
fail it's on but you can discount it uh

2647
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:01,719
from the Swiss bank which is their

2648
01:53:01,719 --> 01:53:04,960

money so and we're talking 20 years ago

2681
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,639
account for inflation it's probably yeah

2682
01:54:43,639 --> 01:54:46,960
but now probably few million it was

2683
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:50,280
always a 30 35% business for me take

2684
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:54,760
home and uh it it came by mistakes like

2685
01:54:54,760 --> 01:54:56,280
I don't know how to cost this garment

2686
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:59,400
I've just come from textile to

2687
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:07,719
appar and I would just say $13 garment

2688
01:55:07,719 --> 01:55:11,520
cost $4 $5 M and they would bargain and

2689
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:14,920
say 12 so at that time I

2690
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:17,679
would that Trend got set and it was Euro

2691
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:20,199
the currency had just come in m

2692
01:55:20,199 --> 01:55:21,760
they moved out for five seven years to

2693
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:23,400
Dollars that's when you started losing a

2694
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:25,920
bit then Global competition primar

2695
01:55:25,920 --> 01:55:27,760
coming in when primar came to Spain they

2696
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:30,320
all became tough because they own Pand

2697
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:34,880
bear berska lefties primar uh Zara oo

2698
01:55:34,880 --> 01:55:37,320
Zara home and they're told about nine

2699
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:40,000
Brands star varas what's your learning

2700
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,639
from this time that

2701
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:45,800
someone who is 21 today can use looking

2702
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:47,560
to start a fashion brand I think this if

2703
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:51,280
you want to start a fashion brand

2704
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:54,480
ever uh first the Pinnacle of course is

2705
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:57,000
creativity you have to have a nag you

2706
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,199
cannot say that if I'm successful go and

2707
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:00,920
make a fashion brand tomorrow which

2708
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:02,560
every most of the guys are trying to do

2709
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,360
it knack for you have to have creativity

2710
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:09,599
you have to you have to look fashionable

2711
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:11,320
before even thinking what is creativity

2712
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:13,880
you both said this how do I Define

2713
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,920
creativity give me a wall and ask

2714
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:17,320
someone for example when he's saying

2715
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:18,719
I'll rearrange your furniture right now

2716
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:21,280
in a different manner will be

2717
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,679
creative and and it's it's about

2718
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:25,199
actually giving the presence of mind to

2719
01:56:25,199 --> 01:56:27,440
that subject someone like you will say

2720
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:28,880
why am I doing this why was even given

2721
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,000
that task my mind is somewhere else I'm

2722
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:34,079
a number guy is it your ability to move

2723
01:56:34,079 --> 01:56:36,119
away from Conformity that you saying is

2724
01:56:36,119 --> 01:56:37,880
creativity I would leave the furniture

2725
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:40,960
this way because yes because confirmity

2726
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:42,639
is

2727
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:45,639
yes I would Define it as the

2728
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:48,480
ability of letting things

2729
01:56:48,480 --> 01:56:50,239
evolve

2730
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,320
in your mind differently from convention

2731
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:54,119
different from convention something

2732
01:56:54,119 --> 01:56:55,920
that's evolving in your mind you're able

2733
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:58,000
to Envision it and then possibly create

2734
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
something out of it at

2735
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,480
least paintings even the products that I

2736
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:04,639
create that's that's yeah but in the

2737
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:07,119
mind people like him maybe I'm sorry I'm

2738
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:08,520
just judging you over and over again

2739
01:57:08,520 --> 01:57:10,280
because I just feel that you're the math

2740
01:57:10,280 --> 01:57:12,320
side of the man so in the brain you have

2741
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,639
a creative side and you have a

2742
01:57:13,639 --> 01:57:16,440
multiplier side sometime you leave

2743
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,719
multiplying because you love the

2744
01:57:17,719 --> 01:57:19,679
creative side so that's what I do my

2745
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:21,880
business from then to now my office is

2746
01:57:21,880 --> 01:57:25,210
white because I paint it three times a

2747
01:57:25,210 --> 01:57:28,400
[Music]

2748
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,880
year

2749
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,239
staircase because I have to see colors

2750
01:57:33,239 --> 01:57:34,960
and I people have to understand colors

2751
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:36,360
in my office and people have to believe

2752
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:38,079
in colors in my office we can't have any

2753
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:40,159
other color as such so it has to be

2754
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:41,760
white high maintenance but yes also

2755
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,079
learned from my dad he would paint the

2756
01:57:43,079 --> 01:57:45,880
house every year so you it would come

2757
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:47,800
from him but tell me something for

2758
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:51,280
example do you have to look at colors to

2759
01:57:51,280 --> 01:57:54,360
get a design out of it or can you

2760
01:57:54,360 --> 01:57:58,000
visualize them and just by thinking

2761
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,239
create something out of it and then put

2762
01:58:00,239 --> 01:58:02,320
it to practice

2763
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,440
both but that's creativity right how do

2764
01:58:04,440 --> 01:58:07,199
you bring a certain emotion to life that

2765
01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:08,679
makes the other person who's

2766
01:58:08,679 --> 01:58:11,920
experiencing it one more time uh get

2767
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,760
some nostalgic feeling right something

2768
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,159
that they have experienced in the past

2769
01:58:15,159 --> 01:58:16,599
and they're able to remember that and

2770
01:58:16,599 --> 01:58:18,320
bringing I think I think I would Define

2771
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:20,679
creativity like that

2772
01:58:20,679 --> 01:58:22,360
no creativity is such

2773
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:24,920
a it's such a common word but a hard

2774
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:29,440
word to Define okay 37 index Journey

2775
01:58:29,440 --> 01:58:31,800
finishes why does it the entire Europe

2776
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:35,639
experience for me kind of dies at 36 37

2777
01:58:35,639 --> 01:58:37,880
38 it was like a because the margins are

2778
01:58:37,880 --> 01:58:40,400
going down the European crisis currency

2779
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:42,520
dollar is they want to trade in dollars

2780
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:43,920
though they in Europe they want to hedge

2781
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,719
and make money out of that

2782
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:48,199
transition uh France was doing very good

01:58:48,199 --> 01:58:51,360

China being white is a

2836
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:13,840
job go so that's how it uh so he he was

2837
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:16,440
a great man and in that time he wanted

2838
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:19,280

they have a department called express

2845
02:01:36,679 --> 02:01:38,079
the missing part of the buyers which

2846
02:01:38,079 --> 02:01:40,440
they didn't buy and the season is

2847
02:01:40,440 --> 02:01:42,280
running so who can give you 45 days

2848
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:43,560
delivery so our lead time in our

2849
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:44,719
business is

2850
02:01:44,719 --> 02:01:48,440
generally uh 100 to 140 days from order

2851
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:51,040
placing to Shipp shipment on the vessel

2852
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:55,079
and uh we I learned the nag of uh things

2853
02:01:55,079 --> 02:01:58,679
from index kind of a process that you

2854
02:01:58,679 --> 02:02:01,800
can ship anything within even 45 days

2855
02:02:01,800 --> 02:02:05,360
and how do you do that uh firstly don't

2856
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:07,560
interact too much with the buyers is it

2857
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:09,719
okay it's it not okay so when I first

2858
02:02:09,719 --> 02:02:11,639

shirts I said but these are the

2870
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:33,040
processes I said I don't know we have

2871
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,159
nobody to even file this what all you've

2872
02:02:35,159 --> 02:02:37,679
sent to us and every other brand in the

2873
02:02:37,679 --> 02:02:41,159
world will sit and do that filing

2874
02:02:41,159 --> 02:02:43,960
job test here test with that chemical

2875
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:45,520
test with this I said it's a garment

2876
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:47,360
here do you think that would have

2877
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:49,639
interfered with the quality of products

2878
02:02:49,639 --> 02:02:52,079
that they were delivering it's a okay I

2879
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:54,000
was a I was luck by charm kind of a

2880
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,880
situation that I had a small Factory in

2881
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:57,480
Bangalore I moved from Bangalore I moved

2882
02:02:57,480 --> 02:02:58,840
to Bangalore because of the factory that

2883
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:01,320
I put up here uh there was another thing

2884
02:03:01,320 --> 02:03:03,480
in between I took the largest loan of

2885
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:07,480
our family of 37 cres and uh put up a

2886
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:11,119
factory in Bangalore first land to buy

2887
02:03:11,119 --> 02:03:12,920
uh would you be the first garment

2888
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:14,560
manufactured having a factory in

2889
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,760
Bangalore no no no no there K moans and

2890
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:19,960
shahis of the world but you invested

2891
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:22,520
money in buying the land to set up your

2892
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:24,400
own everything here when file to file

2893
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:30,119
vidhan s vikas s all the K uh 2004 and

2894
02:03:30,119 --> 02:03:33,599
five how important do you think this is

2895
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:36,199
ability to leverage risk taking ability

2896
02:03:36,199 --> 02:03:37,840
very important for an entrepreneur

2897
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,239
absolutely I mean

2898
02:03:41,239 --> 02:03:44,199
uh let me put it in a in a better way

2899
02:03:44,199 --> 02:03:46,040
that I have a set of family and

2900
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:49,079
mentality right it it's it's a way of of

2901
02:03:49,079 --> 02:03:51,320
thinking a risk taking and there are

2902
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,520
always an outlier I am an outlier and I

2903
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:56,199
said I want to take a loan and I didn't

2904
02:03:56,199 --> 02:03:58,880
badly sell it to my dad but I just gave

2905
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:01,679
him a very different

2906
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:12,400
equation that is that part I didn't

2907
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:14,040
understand or I didn't correlate with

2908
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:16,400
that and I kept putting this can you

2909
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,239
explain it for the audience the concept

2910
02:04:18,239 --> 02:04:21,000
of depe ation when you start a business

2911
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,159
like that one or this one both both oh

2912
02:04:24,159 --> 02:04:25,639
that one was very simple I was putting

2913
02:04:25,639 --> 02:04:27,679
100 bucks and I thought someone

2914
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:30,079
explained

2915
02:04:34,199 --> 02:04:38,840
me my loan was 8 and a half% minus 5%

2916
02:04:38,840 --> 02:04:41,079
for tough scheme textile upgradation

2917
02:04:41,079 --> 02:04:44,559
scheme and which was resulted at 4%

2918
02:04:44,559 --> 02:04:47,360
subsidy after subsidy

2919
02:04:47,360 --> 02:04:50,760
so and then

2920
02:05:00,520 --> 02:05:02,639
so the way you I looked at that was like

2921
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:05,199
you know some god- gift check is coming

2922
02:05:05,199 --> 02:05:08,480
here in the middle for depreciation and

2923
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:11,119
dad didn't this was too much for him to

2924
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:14,559
he just trusted me blindly I

2925
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:17,920
said and how much money did you have

2926
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:22,520
when you borrowed 37 crws I had

2927
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:26,159
uh so my my part was money in your net

2928
02:05:26,159 --> 02:05:29,800
money to your name in this world oh uh

2929
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:33,079
just one apartment uh of three crores

2930
02:05:33,079 --> 02:05:34,880
which also I borrowed from my dad that

2931
02:05:34,880 --> 02:05:36,559
one I I literally told him I want to

2932
02:05:36,559 --> 02:05:38,159
borrow this after marriage I wanted to

2933
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:40,679
move out to an apartment at Bly seaface

2934
02:05:40,679 --> 02:05:42,760
and I said I'll pay you this back in

2935
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:46,000
three years but I did it in one year and

2936
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:49,320
uh that was in when I was 25 first year

2937
02:05:49,320 --> 02:05:53,239
two years after marriage and uh and

2938
02:05:53,239 --> 02:05:55,119
after five years of that I went and put

2939
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:58,639
this Factory and uh so maybe five 10

2940
02:05:58,639 --> 02:06:02,639
Crow what you had to your name 10 10ish

2941
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:05,040
I feel like this is the biggest whenever

2942
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,239
I talk to people who are very successful

2943
02:06:07,239 --> 02:06:08,360
like you

2944
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:11,480
guys often it comes down to risk taking

2945
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:13,840
ability who is willing to put it all on

2946
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:15,480
the line yeah otherwise it doesn't

2947
02:06:15,480 --> 02:06:18,320
happen Okay we were at 37 CR loan when

2948
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:21,520
you had 10 CR to your name I was I was

2949
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:25,520
devastated and screwed that time of this

2950
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:28,000
loan uh I thought I could make a cheaper

2951
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,639
Factory buying my own steel getting it

2952
02:06:29,639 --> 02:06:32,400
converted making a PB structure that

2953
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,199
factory design was designed by me

2954
02:06:34,199 --> 02:06:36,000
because I was stranded in Hamburg

2955
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,440
airport and I L that airport so I

2956
02:06:40,639 --> 02:06:43,360
said I landed up making an airport there

2957
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:49,760
m so it's a 200 ft M ceiling and and uh

2958
02:06:49,760 --> 02:06:53,320
six curve handers

2959
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:55,840
hangers with carts moving inside

2960
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,679
everything automated put the works there

2961
02:06:58,679 --> 02:07:00,679
someone should make a movie on your life

2962
02:07:00,679 --> 02:07:04,119
I know fascinating I made all the s

2963
02:07:04,119 --> 02:07:05,800
machines which came from Italy I said

2964
02:07:05,800 --> 02:07:08,320
they make it in blue color and I have a

2965
02:07:08,320 --> 02:07:10,679
i a setback with

2966
02:07:10,679 --> 02:07:13,800
blue so uh you change the color of so I

2967
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:16,440
said you should be all Ferrari red so

2968
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,800
you are from Italy so you have to do

2969
02:07:17,800 --> 02:07:19,440
that other I don't pay

2970
02:07:19,440 --> 02:07:22,559
you technical problems or I want to go

2971
02:07:22,559 --> 02:07:25,719
see your factory they made red machines

2972
02:07:25,719 --> 02:07:29,880
and uh and uh we did that the entire

2973
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:32,559
building is uh is a submission of design

2974
02:07:32,559 --> 02:07:34,719
what replay Factory is because I

2975
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:37,440
manufactured for replay as well and it's

2976
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:39,679
basically a coal Factory all brick

2977
02:07:39,679 --> 02:07:42,639
building it still has the tracks for

2978
02:07:42,639 --> 02:07:45,079
moving the trolleys in metal the war

2979
02:07:45,079 --> 02:07:47,559
time in the reception going to the

2980
02:07:47,559 --> 02:07:49,280
office and things like that

2981
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:50,719
so I said I want a brick building and

2982
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:53,679
that's when I saw the Builder vangog

2983
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:56,079
total environment Mr Kamal Sagar who's

2984
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:58,360
no less in

2985
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:01,040
creativity uses only Indian materials to

2986
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,880
build his homes for consu customers

2987
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:08,239
apart yeah so I saw his project there

2988
02:08:08,239 --> 02:08:12,520
took a picture uh got caught by

2989
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:15,520
security

2990
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:21,679
because so drew the whole thing but the

2991
02:08:21,679 --> 02:08:24,880
factory the way I expected it at the

2992
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:27,400
same I buil my house here and then

2993
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:29,760

to hell with you if nothing is nothing

2995
02:08:32,679 --> 02:08:34,440
is moving after this what's happening

2996
02:08:34,440 --> 02:08:38,280
here so that three years was stress

2997
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:41,440
crying weeping early morning 6:00 in the

2998
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,679
factory getting it up building it myself

2999
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:45,000
because I took I didn't want to waste

3000
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,599
money on contractors I would have saved

3001
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:49,719
maybe 3 5 months earlier which today I

3002
02:08:49,719 --> 02:08:52,280
don't today I just be finish it fast let

3003
02:08:52,280 --> 02:08:54,159
my turnover

3004
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:57,599
start so that factory created a huge

3005
02:08:57,599 --> 02:08:59,800
impression in Bangalore this is coming

3006
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:03,440
so often in your story no ego Shameless

3007
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:06,000
Relentless is a super power I came to

3008
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,760
your house also like

3009
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:15,480
that about you guys I to just quickly

3010
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:20,840
see I said uh take we'll do that and

3011
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:24,239
then uh comes away uh I went to say

3012
02:09:24,239 --> 02:09:26,079
almost a one and a half year two years

3013
02:09:26,079 --> 02:09:28,159
down one and a half year of depression

3014
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:30,960
kind of a thing because why going to

3015
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:34,360
give my designs there 16 years living

3016
02:09:34,360 --> 02:09:36,880
almost 8 years uh 6 to 8 months in

3017
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:40,040
Europe Hotels beds

3018
02:09:40,040 --> 02:09:42,760
flights I almost landed up being at 19

3019
02:09:42,760 --> 02:09:45,480
to 22 flights a month so I just gave up

3020
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:47,280
all that Milan sounding quite nice to me

3021
02:09:47,280 --> 02:09:50,280
going to Milan Madrid being on

3022
02:09:50,280 --> 02:09:52,760
flight it was it was not exciting at all

3023
02:09:52,760 --> 02:09:55,320
not at all I mean come on you have seen

3024
02:09:55,320 --> 02:09:57,840
any of the very exciting so to save

3025
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,639
money in like earlier days I used to

3026
02:09:59,639 --> 02:10:00,960
sleep in the railway station under the

3027
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:03,800
heater lamp like this uh put my bag for

3028
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:08,440
$2 in the but you were making 10 15 CR a

3029
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:12,880
year2 smoking was my problem not the

3030
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:17,239
drinking bar and straight train next

3031
02:10:17,239 --> 02:10:20,320
country but for I I have a question when

3032
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:22,000
you were setting this Factory up and

3033
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:24,719
that seems to be like a very

3034
02:10:24,719 --> 02:10:26,920
important project that you picked up

3035
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:28,599
right all through your journey

3036
02:10:28,599 --> 02:10:31,440
2005 yeah it it was a brilliant project

3037
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:35,320
of my life so was it because you wanted

3038
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:37,320
your own manufacturing or was it that

3039
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:39,639
the no so I had a small Factory I wanted

3040
02:10:39,639 --> 02:10:41,440
it large so there are ancillaries like

3041
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:42,960
in your manufacturing right I had

3042
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,400
everybody has a garment manufacturing

3043
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:46,480

3053
02:11:09,280 --> 02:11:11,239

that much so that you invest in there's

3090
02:12:39,920 --> 02:12:41,880

more in you I didn't want to even raise

3092
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:45,760
that much I didn't want to raise at all

3093
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:48,119
that comes as a different thing but for

3094
02:12:48,119 --> 02:12:51,840
the guys who are 20 and

3095
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,400
uh

3096
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:56,079
when when you're getting depressed out

3097
02:12:56,079 --> 02:12:58,840
of not getting charm of Designing going

3098
02:12:58,840 --> 02:13:00,040

3099
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:02,000
same garments out of Cambodia and then

3100
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,320
China and Bangladesh and you're getting

3101
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:05,559
just defeated how much you're not going

3102
02:13:05,559 --> 02:13:07,599
to catch the callers and I was not

3103
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:10,599
getting the juice and I always had that

3104
02:13:10,599 --> 02:13:12,280
that there has to be juice in the game

3105
02:13:12,280 --> 02:13:14,159
I'm I can't be that startup blood I'm

3106
02:13:14,159 --> 02:13:18,559
not I am kakur I'm not all these uh that

3107
02:13:18,559 --> 02:13:22,119
that breed of uh or that or the breed of

3108
02:13:22,119 --> 02:13:23,760
mine is very different and my

3109
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:25,360
backgrounds came differently to me and

3110
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:27,920
their backgrounds

3111
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:37,159
came switch how can you take so long to

3112
02:13:37,159 --> 02:13:40,440
find a switch you know so they cannot

3113
02:13:40,440 --> 02:13:42,559
someone who doesn't cannot make 2 plus

3114
02:13:42,559 --> 02:13:46,320
two make money I

3115
02:13:46,320 --> 02:13:49,199
think it's for me I don't know how to

3116
02:13:49,199 --> 02:13:50,920
swallow that yeah and one day I was

3117
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:52,400
standing at Forum mall and I was like

3118
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:54,280
I've created Brands and why men don't

3119
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:57,960
look good here yeah style wise and what

3120
02:13:57,960 --> 02:13:59,800
are these Brands doing actually when I

3121
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:01,599
was then also to come out of this

3122
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:03,040
European business I told all these

3123
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:04,760
European guys please give me your Indian

3124
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:06,880
Office business I'll change everything

3125
02:14:06,880 --> 02:14:08,280
for you I don't want to travel and all

3126
02:14:08,280 --> 02:14:11,199
of that I did all of that it created

3127
02:14:11,199 --> 02:14:12,920
good lines for all the fashion brands

3128
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,960
here and and I was expensive for them

3129
02:14:14,960 --> 02:14:17,159
they could not afford me or things like

3130
02:14:17,159 --> 02:14:20,040
that and I said gidea let's create a

3131
02:14:20,040 --> 02:14:22,400
brand and here I come after 2 years of

3132
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:24,880
depression almost that uh I'm not happy

3133
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:27,360
with my working and nothing I was quite

3134
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,840
suddenly out of the picture and I said I

3135
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:32,000
want to create a brand and what should

3136
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,159
it be and it said I came up with rare

3137
02:14:34,159 --> 02:14:37,040
rabbit and only

3138
02:14:37,040 --> 02:14:40,639
because uh rabbit is a sexual mammal it

3139
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:43,480
multiplies the fastest in the world and

3140
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:45,119
uh did you like the sexual cont

3141
02:14:45,119 --> 02:14:47,000
connotation or the multip part as well

3142
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:48,320
as the multiplication because I

3143
02:14:48,320 --> 02:14:52,360
multiplied Thrice for my my own

3144
02:14:52,360 --> 02:14:57,800
legacy so and uh but men in India should

3145
02:14:57,800 --> 02:15:00,199
be rare and respect the sexuality and be

3146
02:15:00,199 --> 02:15:02,679
rare in that you are a rabbit but be

3147
02:15:02,679 --> 02:15:05,719
rare and the the least you can do is to

3148
02:15:05,719 --> 02:15:08,639
dress so that you can address the your

3149
02:15:08,639 --> 02:15:12,000
opposite that's the whole funa behind it

3150
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,760
is like I'm doing it already bro and you

3151
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:17,239
had Mr vidanta once saying that of

3152
02:15:17,239 --> 02:15:19,760
vidanta Mr agal that to address you have

3153
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:21,880
to dress it was in his fores Magazine

3154
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:23,599
first he actually dresses well do you

3155
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:25,599
think styling in India can be a big

3156
02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:28,000
business

3157
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:31,800
opportunity it is that's why it's uh

3158
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:35,199
probably so we curate uh men's fashion

3159
02:15:35,199 --> 02:15:37,199
in a very different we do it for India

3160
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:39,320
the way you said that hydration cannot

3161
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:41,159
come from Korean recipe because I know

3162
02:15:41,159 --> 02:15:43,719
it's very cold there and they need less

3163
02:15:43,719 --> 02:15:46,440
absorbency and we drive faster we

3164
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:49,639
equatorial belt similarly our tummy is 2

3165
02:15:49,639 --> 02:15:53,079
Ines higher and uh than any average

3166
02:15:53,079 --> 02:15:56,320
person so our last button is to be

3167
02:15:56,320 --> 02:15:58,599
relaxing on that it's horizontal not

3168
02:15:58,599 --> 02:16:02,119
vertical and when I started the brand I

3169
02:16:02,119 --> 02:16:03,400
I just put in a

3170
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:08,360
line and uh I went I created that line I

3171
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:10,800
invested money in that nothing one and a

3172
02:16:10,800 --> 02:16:14,960
half CR 25,000 pieces just made it color

3173
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:16,800
blocked it because if you go to our

3174
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:18,079
store you'll see color block walking in

3175
02:16:18,079 --> 02:16:21,360
us if he's what he I'm only Navy always

3176
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,639
mostly so I will not go to a particular

3177
02:16:23,639 --> 02:16:26,280
section of my store have I styled myself

3178
02:16:26,280 --> 02:16:29,040
well yeah you can say that he's just

3179
02:16:29,040 --> 02:16:31,360
being

3180
02:16:33,398 --> 02:16:36,120
kind if you want tips then I can like

3181
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:38,519
for example and I would like to say it

3182
02:16:38,519 --> 02:16:40,398
because he said not to be kind to him

3183
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:42,638
for me gr and navy don't go together

3184
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:45,718
it's just what goes

3185
02:16:46,679 --> 02:16:48,200
best

3186
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:51,679
monoton does monotone

3187
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:54,558
mean monotone is monotone is only luxury

3188
02:16:54,558 --> 02:16:58,000
we call it high and low mhm so um

3189
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,359
monotone is you high and low is not the

3190
02:17:00,359 --> 02:17:01,519
right way of dressing I'm glad you

3191
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:03,439
didn't ask about me the beige and the

3192
02:17:03,439 --> 02:17:05,200
black and the light gray and the black

3193
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:08,478
or something so no hos it has to be more

3194
02:17:08,478 --> 02:17:10,120
we were in the Inception story of rare

3195
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:13,240
rabbit styling I said this is a lot of

3196
02:17:13,240 --> 02:17:15,959
loss because I've seen all the fashion

3197
02:17:15,959 --> 02:17:19,359
houses of India and all they do is all I

3198
02:17:19,359 --> 02:17:23,478
thought that we we create a structure of

3199
02:17:23,478 --> 02:17:26,519
buying we create clothes and we have an

3200
02:17:26,519 --> 02:17:28,799
actor or a face to the brand and we try

3201
02:17:28,799 --> 02:17:31,280
to sell garments and it's been done

3202
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:34,359
repeatedly in the country and neither I

3203
02:17:34,359 --> 02:17:36,558
have the money or I'm going to or or the

3204
02:17:36,558 --> 02:17:38,200
nag actually after maybe the factory

3205
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:41,040
investment that I can go and get a

3206
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:43,080
celebrity phase and then do you think

3207
02:17:43,080 --> 02:17:45,040
that works for someone Young starting a

3208
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:47,920
brand paying an influencer actor never

3209
02:17:47,920 --> 02:17:51,439
no no why is that for me uh you'll think

3210
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:53,200
differently because it's a women

3211
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:55,120
category on influencer I think

3212
02:17:55,120 --> 02:17:56,599
differently influencers different even

3213
02:17:56,599 --> 02:17:58,318
influencer in fashion I would think

3214
02:17:58,318 --> 02:18:00,638
different yeah but I my office believes

3215
02:18:00,638 --> 02:18:04,638
in it I don't why uh for me it's uh

3216
02:18:04,638 --> 02:18:07,040
shortlived the way I engage myself on

3217
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,439
Instagram I'm also a

3218
02:18:08,439 --> 02:18:12,318
consumer uh I'm too fast and I need new

3219
02:18:12,318 --> 02:18:16,359
new new new new so so it's I don't know

3220
02:18:16,359 --> 02:18:18,920
how much does it resonate to convert and

3221
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:22,240
understand the brand um I

3222
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:27,040
follow among all the actors maybe uh Mr

3223
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,638
bangas diari and amitab ban for two

3224
02:18:30,638 --> 02:18:33,879
different one is Legacy in my life and

3225
02:18:33,879 --> 02:18:35,359
uh one

3226
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:39,799
is uh the new I think the new man of

3227
02:18:39,799 --> 02:18:44,439
substance who speaks great so uh PTI

3228
02:18:44,439 --> 02:18:45,959
some people on social media tell me I

3229
02:18:45,959 --> 02:18:48,558
look like you if you act but is

3230
02:18:48,558 --> 02:18:50,760
exceptional depth but yeah I think you

3231
02:18:50,760 --> 02:18:52,718
could pull off very well in mirzapur I

3232
02:18:52,718 --> 02:18:55,318
can I can I take it as aent he he will

3233
02:18:55,318 --> 02:18:57,799
100% compliment someone should cast him

3234
02:18:57,799 --> 02:19:00,080
no but director can move things and they

3235
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:04,240
need a first cut and that up style look

3236
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:07,760
it can pull it very well you can then

3237
02:19:07,760 --> 02:19:10,638
you have to change a lot have you

3238
02:19:10,638 --> 02:19:13,040
tried so what worked for air rabbit

3239
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:15,240
there's a thousand people trying

3240
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:18,599
rigidity it's very important uh explain

3241
02:19:18,599 --> 02:19:20,679
rigidity rigidity for me is that I'm the

3242
02:19:20,679 --> 02:19:23,318
only we the only brand which has no logo

3243
02:19:23,318 --> 02:19:25,760
on the chest because I never wor a brand

3244
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:28,718
on my chest all my life whatever wealth

3245
02:19:28,718 --> 02:19:30,160
I would have earned in my life I never

3246
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,799
wore a brand which someone can recognize

3247
02:19:31,799 --> 02:19:34,040
what I'm wearing and that's what

3248
02:19:34,040 --> 02:19:36,080
probably Italians taught me or that's

3249
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:38,120
what Spanish fashion taught me they are

3250
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:40,040
never on the face I had a choice of

3251
02:19:40,040 --> 02:19:41,760
doing jeans wear or formal brand this is

3252
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:44,840
the only two fashion concept existing in

3253
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:47,240
India there's nothing called smartware

3254
02:19:47,240 --> 02:19:50,040
and and uh which exists in Europe it

3255
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:53,640
doesn't exist in uh in the rest of the

3256
02:19:53,640 --> 02:19:56,960
world there is no so there's

3257
02:19:56,960 --> 02:19:59,720
jeans uh there's business they call

3258
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:01,439
formal in India and there's a smart the

3259
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:03,960
smart dressing doesn't exist in India

3260
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:05,640
and I said I can't do formal because I

3261
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:08,439
have to compete with such legacies here

3262
02:20:08,439 --> 02:20:11,040
and I can't do genes because it it

3263
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:14,080
caters to youth youth that I've

3264
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:16,359
been

3265
02:20:16,359 --> 02:20:19,000
cig

3266
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:20,880
bike I can

3267
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:25,359
burn and uh to my equation of mind

3268
02:20:25,359 --> 02:20:26,840
because I knew how that two and two

3269
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:29,520
works is that if I don't have a

3270
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:31,880
multiplier I if I don't get that GP I'm

3271
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:35,160
not going to sustain to sell what is GP

3272
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:38,399
gross margin gross profit and to do that

3273
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:39,800
GP everything around it has to be

3274
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:42,520
perfect so my store has to be designed

3275
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:45,160
the way I imagine the Europeans see it

3276
02:20:45,160 --> 02:20:47,040
and there's another underling message

3277
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,160
for all designers or creative people who

3278
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:52,040
want to do anything in India is that do

3279
02:20:52,040 --> 02:20:54,880
it from what you have seen or perceived

3280
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:56,560
from the West because you're trying to

3281
02:20:56,560 --> 02:20:59,760
breave a culture here you're not bre if

3282
02:20:59,760 --> 02:21:01,680
you're making a jutti of chandigar or

3283
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:03,479
you're making a chi of Rajasthan then

3284
02:21:03,479 --> 02:21:04,880
bring that culture here then make your

3285
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:06,840
store look

3286
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:08,520
atal

3287
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:10,800
sandone because that that Essence comes

3288
02:21:10,800 --> 02:21:13,160
from as a juice but if you're trying to

3289
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:15,000
say the word Western World then you have

3290
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:18,399
to be resonating it to a story relling

3291
02:21:18,399 --> 02:21:20,560
communication of design holistic

3292
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:22,600
approach and the difference that you're

3293
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:24,840
trying to First create like oversized

3294
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:26,920
t-shirts is selling very well today what

3295
02:21:26,920 --> 02:21:30,200
you're wearing the boxy fits but it's

3296
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:32,600
already a clutter now now if someone has

3297
02:21:32,600 --> 02:21:33,680
to come with

3298
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:36,080
this he has to be very adaptive that

3299
02:21:36,080 --> 02:21:37,880
I'll make the same boxy but I'm going to

3300
02:21:37,880 --> 02:21:40,120
come with city names today tomorrow can

3301
02:21:40,120 --> 02:21:42,560
I use the word just Buton because it's

3302
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:43,800
not

3303
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:46,359
registered the k something like that how

3304
02:21:46,359 --> 02:21:49,680
does find G like what you're seeing how

3305
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:51,479
do I find it's intution it's your it

3306
02:21:51,479 --> 02:21:53,080
comes out of desperate mistakes most of

3307
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:54,960
the business I think are created by your

3308
02:21:54,960 --> 02:21:58,680
own realization that I miss it in my

3309
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:02,080
life uh I think most of them in product

3310
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:04,479
at least uh unless I don't know what the

3311
02:22:04,479 --> 02:22:07,479
backgrounds of the uh fmcg companies

3312
02:22:07,479 --> 02:22:10,200
otherwise have been commercial ones but

3313
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:12,000
the new ones anything I would say it

3314
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,600
comes from that this is what my style

3315
02:22:13,600 --> 02:22:15,520
was it became brand the blue orange

3316
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:18,920
became a brand MH I respect them the j

3317
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:20,439
walking because that's the cult that's

3318
02:22:20,439 --> 02:22:22,920
the way work the design I think these

3319
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:24,520
guys would have probably been somewhere

3320
02:22:24,520 --> 02:22:26,479
in the world or got hold of that one

3321
02:22:26,479 --> 02:22:28,640
piece and they said That's My Style that

3322
02:22:28,640 --> 02:22:32,680
style became so popular among the

3323
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:35,000
friends do you think because the

3324
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,520
clothing Market is so penetrated today

3325
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:40,439
in terms of access you have to hit a

3326
02:22:40,439 --> 02:22:43,319
niche and play that so rightly said in

3327
02:22:43,319 --> 02:22:45,920
your lines only we are a clothing

3328
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:47,760
manufacturing country

3329
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:51,319
we're not a fashion business country we

3330
02:22:51,319 --> 02:22:54,359
don't create fashion we don't buy design

3331
02:22:54,359 --> 02:22:55,920
sell fashion other than the designers

3332
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:57,760
that we have who are doing I think the

3333
02:22:57,760 --> 02:22:59,439
best in the world also they're world

3334
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:02,200
ranking we have Dior making their uh

3335
02:23:02,200 --> 02:23:05,359
their entire marriage gowns in Bombay

3336
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:07,840
that's also embroidered in India I mean

3337
02:23:07,840 --> 02:23:09,960
I have seen back in those day Armani

3338
02:23:09,960 --> 02:23:13,439
sending the suits lafel just the silk

3339
02:23:13,439 --> 02:23:16,080
from Italy to lakau to do one embroidery

3340
02:23:16,080 --> 02:23:18,240
of chicken work and goes flying back

3341
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:20,920
there to stitch it with a suit there so

3342
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:23,840
that's how they and they go that

3343
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:26,640
mile to and they in those days when

3344
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,040
there's no Instagram and all of that

3345
02:23:28,040 --> 02:23:30,200
they were doing it from an archived book

3346
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:34,000
and a designer there is as eager bird

3347
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,240
who's taking that trouble to go to the

3348
02:23:36,240 --> 02:23:38,000
the the Instagram which is the library

3349
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,319
then picking up something and trying to

3350
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:41,880
throw that knowledge in the Armani's

3351
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:44,319
office that I want to do this it's

3352
02:23:44,319 --> 02:23:46,080
available in India it's in

3353
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:48,479
lakau and they said okay talk to Global

3354
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:49,960

3355
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:52,000
your buying office in Delhi we'll send

3356
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:53,570
it to them they'll get this embroidery

3357
02:23:53,570 --> 02:23:56,629
[Music]

3358
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:06,120
done EMB what was the Breakthrough point

3359
02:24:06,120 --> 02:24:07,880
for R rabbit I would say the breaking

3360
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:11,040
point to answer is that uh when we were

3361
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,240
stuck on our business uh so the biggest

3362
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:16,680
challenge we faced is getting real

3363
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:19,000
estate

3364
02:24:23,279 --> 02:24:24,680
that's why I was asking her again again

3365
02:24:24,680 --> 02:24:26,640
in your industry do they pick up that

3366
02:24:26,640 --> 02:24:29,479
call and uh I proposed this once when I

3367
02:24:29,479 --> 02:24:31,120
didn't have one store also with one of

3368
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:33,359
the largest Builders and developers that

3369
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:35,720
you'll have such millions of square fets

3370
02:24:35,720 --> 02:24:37,680
give 3,000 square F feet in a corner of

3371
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:39,880
a mall for young guys to come and

3372
02:24:39,880 --> 02:24:42,439
demonstrate their talent without signing

3373
02:24:42,439 --> 02:24:46,120
those Loi big big Pages just give him so

3374
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:48,520
much table one hanger is that how malls

3375
02:24:48,520 --> 02:24:50,600
work do they care which brand is coming

3376
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:52,640
so much or is it about the rate per

3377
02:24:52,640 --> 02:24:55,200
square feet I'm trying to sign or get no

3378
02:24:55,200 --> 02:24:56,840
they have to create a

3379
02:24:56,840 --> 02:24:59,240
ecosystem they cannot have five rows of

3380
02:24:59,240 --> 02:25:01,720
chocolate and ice cream and coffee shops

3381
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:03,279
it's an ecosystem which I've learn and

3382
02:25:03,279 --> 02:25:04,800
it's a very hard business they are also

3383
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:06,760
cracking they so how do if I start they

3384
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:08,200
trusted rare rabbit they give a store

3385
02:25:08,200 --> 02:25:11,120
and imagine nobody comes in there so I

3386
02:25:11,120 --> 02:25:14,279
kind of bring down their footfall and if

3387
02:25:14,279 --> 02:25:16,560
they do 20 mistakes on a floor that

3388
02:25:16,560 --> 02:25:19,160
floor is dead the 21st store will not

3389
02:25:19,160 --> 02:25:22,600
get rented because that person said

3390
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:27,240
foot there are some malls who do Man

3391
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:29,600
Woman mix they're not dissecting

3392
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:32,439
properly so if I'm a brand what can I do

3393
02:25:32,439 --> 02:25:34,840
to be more attractive to a

3394
02:25:34,840 --> 02:25:38,279
mall like I'm 21 I start a brand I want

3395
02:25:38,279 --> 02:25:41,160
store space impossible is there no hack

3396
02:25:41,160 --> 02:25:42,720
I would not say the word impossible just

3397
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:45,680
forget it maybe in tier one mall can't I

3398
02:25:45,680 --> 02:25:49,200
go to a tier two Mall forget it really

3399
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:51,640
so you're telling me if a mall has empty

3400
02:25:51,640 --> 02:25:54,040
store space and I'm willing to pay the

3401
02:25:54,040 --> 02:25:59,040
rent they won't give me they yeah see

3402
02:25:59,040 --> 02:26:01,240
and they're not wrong who are you you're

3403
02:26:01,240 --> 02:26:03,279
a kid who started with a garment someone

3404
02:26:03,279 --> 02:26:06,120
paying them the rent yeah but your store

3405
02:26:06,120 --> 02:26:08,359
will

3406
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:18,800
open

3407
02:26:23,399 --> 02:26:25,520
but he's running a ecosystem so what you

3408
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:27,439
seem to be telling me is you have to do

3409
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:30,120
this only only as a suggestion or advice

3410
02:26:30,120 --> 02:26:31,640
whatever I have learned from is go to a

3411
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:34,359
High Street pull up your sleeves go open

3412
02:26:34,359 --> 02:26:38,319
a store High Street on the roads I mean

3413
02:26:38,319 --> 02:26:40,840
like indan nagar is a High Street and

3414
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:42,840
there you will get Space yeah okay last

3415
02:26:42,840 --> 02:26:45,760
two points from you hack for somebody

3416
02:26:45,760 --> 02:26:47,600
trying to start a clothing Brand This is

3417
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:49,560
actually personal interest to me the

3418
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:53,600
hack for someone young find a difference

3419
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:55,760
give us some examples of differences you

3420
02:26:55,760 --> 02:27:00,200
think might work today today khadi khadi

3421
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:02,000
we are the only country in the world mix

3422
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:03,800
this fiber and this Yan you think going

3423
02:27:03,800 --> 02:27:07,120
back to India using bandani that Kara

3424
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:09,680
khadi putting these together so that's

3425
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,960
women's side of the kadi you know uh

3426
02:27:11,960 --> 02:27:14,040
which is very highly embellished still

3427
02:27:14,040 --> 02:27:16,080
with a lot of work which is very women

3428
02:27:16,080 --> 02:27:19,200
MH the true true kadi in India it's a

3429
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:23,800
textile Gandhi kadi the Gandhi

3430
02:27:23,800 --> 02:27:26,720
kadi it is the best cotton you can touch

3431
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:30,359
there's K's cotton kadi is nothing but

3432
02:27:30,359 --> 02:27:33,120
uh raw cotton which has got seeds still

3433
02:27:33,120 --> 02:27:36,840
in it not removed the seed uh kins are

3434
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:38,880
not removed from a minut it's a little

3435
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,840
rough to touch it's rough uh the organic

3436
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:43,520
if this was an organic this would be if

3437
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:46,840
recycled then it is going to be rough uh

3438
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:49,439
you Dy it with only vegetable dieses and

3439
02:27:49,439 --> 02:27:51,880
everything you spin it this way by hand

3440
02:27:51,880 --> 02:27:54,680
like Gandhi g you on the chakra yeah and

3441
02:27:54,680 --> 02:27:56,640
so you're very uneven yarn and then you

3442
02:27:56,640 --> 02:27:59,600
weave it by hand it's the softest fabric

3443
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:01,640
it's the most organic fa fabric that you

3444
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:03,359
want to be in and there are Villages

3445
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:05,479
living on that today uh they're

3446
02:28:05,479 --> 02:28:07,479
desperate to get even money today raw

3447
02:28:07,479 --> 02:28:09,520
mango is doing a brilliant job the sis

3448
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:13,120
are expensive and today the advice to a

3449
02:28:13,120 --> 02:28:15,760
20- year is go and try to touch khadi

3450
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:17,279
because it's the only Fabric in the

3451
02:28:17,279 --> 02:28:19,680
world which only exists in India there's

3452
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:23,160
no other every other fabric is global

3453
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:26,040
this is only Indian interesting idea we

3454
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:28,680
should we should try t-shirts in

3455
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:31,439
Khali t-shirts

3456
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:34,840
t-shirt you'll have shorts leave it by

3457
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:37,080
hand

3458
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:39,840
shorts It's a rigid fabric you can make

3459
02:28:39,840 --> 02:28:42,760
this I'm so intrigued because I think

3460
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:44,560
apart from beauty if there's anything

3461
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:47,399
else that I ever think I would

3462
02:28:47,399 --> 02:28:49,479
want to build or try my hands on would

3463
02:28:49,479 --> 02:28:50,279
be

3464
02:28:50,279 --> 02:28:53,319
fashion and not that I've thought about

3465
02:28:53,319 --> 02:28:55,680
it much but everything that you're

3466
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:57,240
saying is sort

3467
02:28:57,240 --> 02:29:00,200
of building a story in my mind so when

3468
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:03,279
you say kadi I'm already thinking can

3469
02:29:03,279 --> 02:29:06,080
kadi be built a brand out of kadi can it

3470
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:09,479
be built at scale would it be at also it

3471
02:29:09,479 --> 02:29:11,800
can be built at a scale yeah 100% in

3472
02:29:11,800 --> 02:29:15,040
India and I think before I retire it

3473
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:18,319
would be done the cloth is would the

3474
02:29:18,319 --> 02:29:20,840
pricing would be premium right yeah it's

3475
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:23,120
econom be so and patriotism is in right

3476
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:26,279
now patriotism is in right now uh so we

3477
02:29:26,279 --> 02:29:28,760
all wear denims blue denims we all think

3478
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:31,760
denim is Western right the denim comes

3479
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:36,000
from indigo blue denim is basically the

3480
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,960
NES it's the NES which is France because

3481
02:29:39,960 --> 02:29:43,279
the twi we was first woven there the

3482
02:29:43,279 --> 02:29:45,560
blue added in that was by the Americans

3483
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:49,200
who took the blue Leaf from Tamil Nadu

3484
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:51,120
so our Leaf is when it

3485
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:54,040
dries it it becomes blue that green leaf

3486
02:29:54,040 --> 02:29:55,640
becomes

3487
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:58,399
blue and we make we are the only country

3488
02:29:58,399 --> 02:30:01,920
who grows organic denim so advise to

3489
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:04,240
them they should find these kind

3490
02:30:04,240 --> 02:30:06,720
of and fashion designing is not cut

3491
02:30:06,720 --> 02:30:09,560
paste pieces here and there it's about

3492
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:12,439
creating a complete right look and to

3493
02:30:12,439 --> 02:30:15,720
get the margin do a good storytelling

3494
02:30:15,720 --> 02:30:18,840
alongside with it m you have to sell the

3495
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:20,880
story with it you just sold your story

3496
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:24,200
being a a financial wizard Guy saying

3497
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:28,560
that 6 hours charity City recyclable

3498
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:30,800
organic you have to speak

3499
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:33,359
something story most important very

3500
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:35,520
important that's where IP sits that

3501
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:38,080
story comes story is IP story is the

3502
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,479
biggest St the emotional connect with

3503
02:30:39,479 --> 02:30:41,560
your consumer today's IP which goes

3504
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:43,960
beyond products like even for you like

3505
02:30:43,960 --> 02:30:46,399
that yeah story sells absolutely

3506
02:30:46,399 --> 02:30:48,359
absolutely I think I was able to

3507
02:30:48,359 --> 02:30:51,000
establish that connect first the story

3508
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:53,640
started selling before the product

3509
02:30:53,640 --> 02:30:56,479
started selling so in our store you will

3510
02:30:56,479 --> 02:30:59,960
get fragrance in all 120 stores the same

3511
02:30:59,960 --> 02:31:03,399
our office smells the same uh we get

3512
02:31:03,399 --> 02:31:07,240
complaints uh when our Omni Channel goes

3513
02:31:07,240 --> 02:31:09,240
that youve sent us used garments because

3514
02:31:09,240 --> 02:31:11,600
our clothes smell off so you have a lot

3515
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:13,720
of perspiration when you suw right there

3516
02:31:13,720 --> 02:31:14,399
are

3517
02:31:14,399 --> 02:31:18,479
69 110 people who handle one

3518
02:31:18,479 --> 02:31:20,960
garment and it's their perspiration

3519
02:31:20,960 --> 02:31:22,680
which is coming from what they've eaten

3520
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:24,120
and if they wedge or non wed is a

3521
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:26,680
different smell from your skin as well

3522
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:28,800
pay attention to detail yeah so you have

3523
02:31:28,800 --> 02:31:32,120
to neutralize your fragrance of your

3524
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:33,920
each garment when you wear your TT do

3525
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:36,800
that your store has to smell so if the

3526
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:39,439
store is smelling then the Garment will

3527
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:42,359
smell less yeah no it takes that but how

3528
02:31:42,359 --> 02:31:43,880
do you do it online when you're selling

3529
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:45,760
it online so when it goes Omni order and

3530
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:47,439
it goes from store people think we have

3531
02:31:47,439 --> 02:31:49,439
sent them wor garments so they Lodge a

3532
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:52,160
complaint for that so we are busy always

3533
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:54,720
explaining that it's been our so these

3534
02:31:54,720 --> 02:31:56,600
are some rigidity of your business plan

3535
02:31:56,600 --> 02:31:58,319
you should never deviate with give me

3536
02:31:58,319 --> 02:32:01,200
another word for rigidity I think

3537
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:05,240
ad be be be core be stuck to your core

3538
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:06,439
concept

3539
02:32:06,439 --> 02:32:09,319
particular no I think you I see I

3540
02:32:09,319 --> 02:32:10,560
designed the brand saying the rare

3541
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:12,920
rabbit will be written here on the belly

3542
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:15,279
because Italians if they wear a

3543
02:32:15,279 --> 02:32:18,319
blazer their name generally is here

3544
02:32:18,319 --> 02:32:19,920
you're willing to take a different and

3545
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:21,760
then you don't even deviate yes you you

3546
02:32:21,760 --> 02:32:23,640
take a contrarian View and back it fully

3547
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:25,479
so fellow friend of mine in this

3548
02:32:25,479 --> 02:32:27,120
business he said Manish we to messed it

3549
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:29,359
up

3550
02:32:44,520 --> 02:32:46,760
we you manag to keep keep that noise

3551
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:50,479
away I so uh because you said I'm rare

3552
02:32:50,479 --> 02:32:53,040
or I never listened to them we are the

3553
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:54,399
only brand in the country we don't do

3554
02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:57,560
Road shows we don't show our collection

3555
02:32:57,560 --> 02:32:59,680
and take bookings from the entire trade

3556
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:02,640
of 700 people who we 700 points we sell

3557
02:33:02,640 --> 02:33:05,600
today we don't show our collection and

3558
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:08,800
take orders from them we just send what

3559
02:33:08,800 --> 02:33:10,960
we think is right for them for their

3560
02:33:10,960 --> 02:33:15,120
Market because our AI uh our research

3561
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:16,760
our understanding

3562
02:33:16,760 --> 02:33:18,359
would you say would you like phrase it

3563
02:33:18,359 --> 02:33:20,000
in a manner saying client doesn't know

3564
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,640
what he truly wants in India for

3565
02:33:22,640 --> 02:33:25,640
sure and at the same time India is

3566
02:33:25,640 --> 02:33:27,720
according to me the most hungry country

3567
02:33:27,720 --> 02:33:30,760
to to ask for give me more and give me

3568
02:33:30,760 --> 02:33:33,359
new just don't give me the

3569
02:33:33,359 --> 02:33:36,160
same and what's the cycle of

3570
02:33:36,160 --> 02:33:39,439
innovation so in uh I'll give you a I'll

3571
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:40,920
give you a better

3572
02:33:40,920 --> 02:33:43,279
understanding in Zara Innovation is

3573
02:33:43,279 --> 02:33:46,399
everyday our office is every day in

3574
02:33:46,399 --> 02:33:49,120
India fashion is two season divided you

3575
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:51,680
buy once and you buy twice second fall

3576
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:54,600
winter spring we buy every

3577
02:33:54,600 --> 02:33:57,800
day it doesn't stop if I've seen this I

3578
02:33:57,800 --> 02:34:00,560
can go back and I'll

3579
02:34:00,560 --> 02:34:02,720
say so for example let's say you've

3580
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:05,600
designed this shirt and you've listed it

3581
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:09,080
on online in your stores etc for how

3582
02:34:09,080 --> 02:34:10,800
long do you think it'll stay relevant

3583
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:13,960
till you have to change not more than 2

3584
02:34:13,960 --> 02:34:15,920
and a half 3 months 2 and a half 3

3585
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:17,080
months

3586
02:34:17,080 --> 02:34:18,640
that's very quick more than that that's

3587
02:34:18,640 --> 02:34:21,479
very quick and we are the largest online

3588
02:34:21,479 --> 02:34:23,880
in the country not metaphorically but in

3589
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:26,359
genuine

3590
02:34:26,560 --> 02:34:29,720
terms also because this also so all our

3591
02:34:29,720 --> 02:34:31,680
businesses are by accident and people of

3592
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:33,840
20 should not vary of that and scared of

3593
02:34:33,840 --> 02:34:36,920
that I didn't get stores I have 25,000

3594
02:34:36,920 --> 02:34:39,560
pieces in my house I had to start a

3595
02:34:39,560 --> 02:34:42,319
website I started the website 2016 I

3596
02:34:42,319 --> 02:34:44,240
think I was the only one as a website

3597
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:47,000
there to design that I'm very particular

3598
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,800
about my font so my font doesn't change

3599
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:51,920
on our website Our Deck letters anything

3600
02:34:51,920 --> 02:34:53,840
you write will be the same font you use

3601
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:55,479
this word a lot

3602
02:34:55,479 --> 02:34:57,960
particular is attention to detail yeah

3603
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:01,399
yeah we don't I mean it's so but you get

3604
02:35:01,399 --> 02:35:03,520
these kind of hindrances and you should

3605
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:04,920
not

3606
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:08,240
move because that's how you stand a bit

3607
02:35:08,240 --> 02:35:10,200
do you think chains are

3608
02:35:10,200 --> 02:35:12,439
in

3609
02:35:12,439 --> 02:35:16,359
similar not bad quite je obious so yeah

3610
02:35:16,359 --> 02:35:18,120
this this chain actually is made by one

3611
02:35:18,120 --> 02:35:20,160

digital is it retail we are 50 store

3633
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:13,840
store because country Dynamics roads are

3635
02:36:16,399 --> 02:36:18,160
what great Builders are building today

3636
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:20,399
as terms of mouth it's crazy it's where

3637
02:36:20,399 --> 02:36:21,520
all they are doing what all they're

3638
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:23,040
doing is like he loves the stores right

3639
02:36:23,040 --> 02:36:25,680
like I you can see it I can see but I

3640
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:27,319
have a very different statistic going on

3641
02:36:27,319 --> 02:36:29,240
in my mind and I was reading we play our

3642
02:36:29,240 --> 02:36:31,640
playlist music for all 6 160 stores from

3643
02:36:31,640 --> 02:36:34,359
our office really you control the music

3644
02:36:34,359 --> 02:36:36,840
of your store centrally is it

3645
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:39,680
centrally okay so what I'm getting

3646
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:42,880
takeway is quite complicated the you're

3647
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:46,399
a complicated man easy

3648
02:36:46,399 --> 02:36:48,000
be straightforward you'll be you'll make

3649
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,279
everything easy you're a avoidant

3650
02:36:50,279 --> 02:36:51,439
attachment

3651
02:36:51,439 --> 02:36:55,920
type do you worry about being vulnerable

3652
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:57,279
or showing your

3653
02:36:57,279 --> 02:37:01,120
insecurities no I don't no I I'm the

3654
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:03,279
most open person you can ever get to

3655
02:37:03,279 --> 02:37:06,040
know about anything that's why he said

3656
02:37:06,040 --> 02:37:09,840
he has the most flexible back about

3657
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:12,920
anything again creative parallel with

3658
02:37:12,920 --> 02:37:16,240
you I think I think attention to detail

3659
02:37:16,240 --> 02:37:18,279
is something that came across while you

3660
02:37:18,279 --> 02:37:20,880
were speaking many many times from the

3661
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:24,240
perfume in all your stores to the music

3662
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:26,439
to where the buttons are Indian waste is

3663
02:37:26,439 --> 02:37:27,680
2 in

3664
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:30,560
higher so whoever is attempting this

3665
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:33,600
needs to pay that much attention to

3666
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,680
detail to build in the space that young

3667
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,479
21y old and also keep looking around

3668
02:37:37,479 --> 02:37:39,319
your own

3669
02:37:39,319 --> 02:37:43,520
Society story most important also IP

3670
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:45,800
your story is as important as as the

3671
02:37:45,800 --> 02:37:48,399
product if not more yeah

3672
02:37:48,399 --> 02:37:50,600
absolutely another big thing that came

3673
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:53,200
across from Manish no ego Shameless

3674
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:56,640
Relentless is a superp power ability or

3675
02:37:56,640 --> 02:37:59,560
willingness to bend your back very very

3676
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:01,560
important can't have shame when you're

3677
02:38:01,560 --> 02:38:03,040
asking for business and and not to

3678
02:38:03,040 --> 02:38:04,760
forget India is a very colorful country

3679
02:38:04,760 --> 02:38:06,840
so don't hide from

3680
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:11,160
color and I think in a world can be your

3681
02:38:11,160 --> 02:38:14,560
superpower say again in a world full of

3682
02:38:14,560 --> 02:38:17,200
ego that can actually become your

3683
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:20,279
superpower the world full of ego yeah

3684
02:38:20,279 --> 02:38:22,680
not having one

3685
02:38:22,680 --> 02:38:26,760
yeah yeah moving on to rates I shouldn't

3686
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:29,680
have come interjected it was doing all

3687
02:38:29,680 --> 02:38:33,080

unassuming sweet amicable person

3697
02:38:56,760 --> 02:38:58,479
basically he doesn't show his real self

3698
02:38:58,479 --> 02:39:01,560
to anyone somebody so nice can't be so

3699
02:39:01,560 --> 02:39:05,560
successful fundamental belief in life I

3700
02:39:05,560 --> 02:39:08,800
agree so the mask that he puts on is so

3701
02:39:08,800 --> 02:39:11,040
strong and it's always on which must be

3702
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:14,279
so much work that he must be tired so he

3703
02:39:14,279 --> 02:39:16,160
has too many masks

3704
02:39:16,160 --> 02:39:18,399
no no no I think n first gives you so

3705
02:39:18,399 --> 02:39:21,200
much love he say sweet unassuming very

3706
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:24,760
amicable and then goes for the kill like

3707
02:39:24,760 --> 02:39:27,040
okay tell us about your personality I

3708
02:39:27,040 --> 02:39:29,240
think you told some of it so I'll borrow

3709
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:32,040
mhm I think uh calm I try to make sure

3710
02:39:32,040 --> 02:39:35,160
that there's just a sense of calm as in

3711
02:39:35,160 --> 02:39:37,920
myself and then around me if possible

3712
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:39,359
but if I can't keep it around me at

3713
02:39:39,359 --> 02:39:44,800
least inside of me um why I like it that

3714
02:39:44,800 --> 02:39:47,840
way you never get angry no I do get

3715
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,479
angry sometimes but do you emote when

3716
02:39:49,479 --> 02:39:51,279
you get angry do you show

3717
02:39:51,279 --> 02:39:56,720
it yes yes but uh I think um it is not

3718
02:39:56,720 --> 02:39:59,600
as volatile I think uh I'll try to put

3719
02:39:59,600 --> 02:40:01,840
it in words uh I try to put it in words

3720
02:40:01,840 --> 02:40:04,359
more than in actions I think when was

3721
02:40:04,359 --> 02:40:06,600
the last time you cried when was the

3722
02:40:06,600 --> 02:40:07,840
last time I

3723
02:40:07,840 --> 02:40:12,240
cried I think I cried when uh I had the

3724
02:40:12,240 --> 02:40:15,399
I had I had my baby in my hands yeah I

3725
02:40:15,399 --> 02:40:18,200
think think um it's it was hard not to

3726
02:40:18,200 --> 02:40:22,120
cry then uh but yeah I think before that

3727
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:26,120
before that I cry probably every U few

3728
02:40:26,120 --> 02:40:27,880
months sometimes out of no reason

3729
02:40:27,880 --> 02:40:31,080
sometimes out of happiness I think um

3730
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:34,319
one thing that actually I know I I cried

3731
02:40:34,319 --> 02:40:38,040
I cry a lot

3732
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:41,279
so I

3733
02:40:41,319 --> 02:40:44,800
deeply because of my upbringing family

3734
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:48,920
and so on um believe in existence of God

3735
02:40:48,920 --> 02:40:52,800
so whenever I'm in U uh you know a place

3736
02:40:52,800 --> 02:40:55,880
of worship or even at my own home at at

3737
02:40:55,880 --> 02:40:59,399
the place I worship I think sometimes I

3738
02:40:59,399 --> 02:41:02,120
end up crying probably for no reason can

3739
02:41:02,120 --> 02:41:04,560
I extrapolate and ask you why you

3740
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:07,120
believe in

3741
02:41:09,240 --> 02:41:12,359
God I

3742
02:41:14,040 --> 02:41:16,840
think it's a fun to put in words but I

3743
02:41:16,840 --> 02:41:19,399
think uh there have been multiple I

3744
02:41:19,399 --> 02:41:22,560
genuinely personally believe that uh I

3745
02:41:22,560 --> 02:41:25,760
did not deserve all I have gotten all my

3746
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:27,640
life so I'm just genuinely thankful and

3747
02:41:27,640 --> 02:41:30,120
I feel like there's probably a greater

3748
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:33,560
power which has just given me this

3749
02:41:33,560 --> 02:41:36,960
opportunity uh so I think that's

3750
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:39,520
probably and again I'm just trying to

3751
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:41,160
play it back but that's probably the

3752
02:41:41,160 --> 02:41:43,200
reason can I tell you something that is

3753
02:41:43,200 --> 02:41:46,080
slightly similar between me and you

3754
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:49,960
is we've been on this train of youngest

3755
02:41:49,960 --> 02:41:53,960
a youngest B youngest C because I think

3756
02:41:53,960 --> 02:41:55,680
even though I'm significantly older than

3757
02:41:55,680 --> 02:41:59,000
you I think in our own times we were

3758
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,680
young at doing

3759
02:42:01,680 --> 02:42:05,720
something uh a very natural parallel to

3760
02:42:05,720 --> 02:42:08,720
that something I face deeply right is I

3761
02:42:08,720 --> 02:42:11,240
have imposer complex in so many

3762
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:14,960
different facets of my life deep down I

3763
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:16,240
believe

3764
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:18,080
I have gotten something I have not

3765
02:42:18,080 --> 02:42:19,520
worked enough

3766
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:23,680
for uh I also believe I'm not the

3767
02:42:23,680 --> 02:42:26,760
smartest I'm not the most hardworking

3768
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:28,359
because there is a lot of tangible

3769
02:42:28,359 --> 02:42:31,520
evidence for this I can find you 10,000

3770
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:33,240
people who are smarter than me and more

3771
02:42:33,240 --> 02:42:36,160
hardworking than me absolutely uh we

3772
02:42:36,160 --> 02:42:39,160
happen to be in that position in a very

3773
02:42:39,160 --> 02:42:43,840
circumstantial manner yeah uh belief in

3774
02:42:43,840 --> 02:42:46,520
something that you have never touched or

3775
02:42:46,520 --> 02:42:48,880
felt like God I'll probably get trolled

3776
02:42:48,880 --> 02:42:52,200
for this trolled as but belief in

3777
02:42:52,200 --> 02:42:55,000
something that you haven't touched is

3778
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,720
also a byproduct of our

3779
02:42:57,720 --> 02:43:00,279
circumstance when you say God what is

3780
02:43:00,279 --> 02:43:02,640
the concept of God to you what do you

3781
02:43:02,640 --> 02:43:03,920
mean by

3782
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:07,640
God uh in my view just a greater power

3783
02:43:07,640 --> 02:43:08,840
than

3784
02:43:08,840 --> 02:43:12,000
humans I think that's uh my concept of

3785
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:14,279
God are you taking the religious

3786
02:43:14,279 --> 02:43:17,560
connotation I think

3787
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:20,680
um I know there is a fine line between

3788
02:43:20,680 --> 02:43:22,880
these but I would say spiritual not

3789
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:25,479
religious so organized religion no

3790
02:43:25,479 --> 02:43:27,000
spirituality yes is that what you're

3791
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,800
saying no I'm not like for me personally

3792
02:43:29,800 --> 02:43:33,560
I think um the belief in the power of

3793
02:43:33,560 --> 02:43:36,000
spirituality is higher but what is

3794
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,920
spirituality I often ask people to

3795
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:38,920
Define

3796
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:41,439
spirituality each one tells me a

3797
02:43:41,439 --> 02:43:43,800
different answer what is R's and that is

3798
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:46,040
what it is supposed to be I think for me

3799
02:43:46,040 --> 02:43:49,880
it is uh like I mentioned to you I think

3800
02:43:49,880 --> 02:43:52,279
you may have heard about uh in a lot of

3801
02:43:52,279 --> 02:43:54,760
books people write uh this person is

3802
02:43:54,760 --> 02:43:58,040
God-fearing um and I think uh what it

3803
02:43:58,040 --> 02:44:00,279
basically means to me is

3804
02:44:00,279 --> 02:44:03,279
that there is somebody who's keeping a

3805
02:44:03,279 --> 02:44:06,399
sense of a check a check or an oversight

3806
02:44:06,399 --> 02:44:09,479
on us and is a greater power than us and

3807
02:44:09,479 --> 02:44:11,240
has the abilities to do things which

3808
02:44:11,240 --> 02:44:13,800
humans cannot do themselves you mean in

3809
02:44:13,800 --> 02:44:15,600
terms of punishment because your

3810
02:44:15,600 --> 02:44:18,640
derivative word Was Fear I wouldn't say

3811
02:44:18,640 --> 02:44:20,160
uh fear

3812
02:44:20,160 --> 02:44:23,600
but uh I think more a Guiding Light sort

3813
02:44:23,600 --> 02:44:25,520
of a way to make sure that you can reach

3814
02:44:25,520 --> 02:44:28,200
your purpose uh for whatever you are

3815
02:44:28,200 --> 02:44:31,200
around I mean uh I I liked what you

3816
02:44:31,200 --> 02:44:33,160
mentioned I was when I was coming by I

3817
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:34,520
was watching your recent video in which

3818
02:44:34,520 --> 02:44:37,080
you mentioned about uh we take ourselves

3819
02:44:37,080 --> 02:44:39,960
too seriously and um you know that

3820
02:44:39,960 --> 02:44:41,760
fundamentally you know you're around for

3821
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:43,439
a certain point of time you do the best

3822
02:44:43,439 --> 02:44:45,479
you can but the the concept conceptt of

3823
02:44:45,479 --> 02:44:48,200
legacy is flawed uh inherently I think I

3824
02:44:48,200 --> 02:44:50,080
I fully agree with that so I think the

3825
02:44:50,080 --> 02:44:52,359
whole point is um for all the time

3826
02:44:52,359 --> 02:44:54,359
you're around you try to do the best you

3827
02:44:54,359 --> 02:44:56,359
can uh despite like you mentioned I

3828
02:44:56,359 --> 02:44:57,600
agree with your point that you mentioned

3829
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:00,319
earlier which is the conscious mind

3830
02:45:00,319 --> 02:45:02,359
tries to do all the right things but

3831
02:45:02,359 --> 02:45:03,880
subconsciously You're Still Human so

3832
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:05,920
that so so it's like a constant battle

3833
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:06,920
right that you want to make sure that

3834
02:45:06,920 --> 02:45:10,560
you're consciously doing as much to

3835
02:45:10,560 --> 02:45:12,319
pursue your purpose as possible so I

3836
02:45:12,319 --> 02:45:14,240
think that's how I would put

3837
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:16,840
spirituality a question I did you fear

3838
02:45:16,840 --> 02:45:20,359
God or submit to God much later in life

3839
02:45:20,359 --> 02:45:22,359
or it was always your it was actually

3840
02:45:22,359 --> 02:45:24,240
due to upbringing yeah I think it

3841
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:26,319
upbring it kind of changed for me in the

3842
02:45:26,319 --> 02:45:27,760
last 10

3843
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:30,680
years so I grew up in a place in southa

3844
02:45:30,680 --> 02:45:34,279
place called Raa it's um I think 60% of

3845
02:45:34,279 --> 02:45:38,760
the population is adasi which is tribals

3846
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:42,640
right um there is a temple near a house

3847
02:45:42,640 --> 02:45:45,800
uh it's called majaran Temple but she's

3848
02:45:45,800 --> 02:45:48,880
the tribal goddesses who effectively

3849
02:45:48,880 --> 02:45:51,680
protects our town it's said and there's

3850
02:45:51,680 --> 02:45:53,880
history behind it and so on so for

3851
02:45:53,880 --> 02:45:55,359
examplea you would have heard about

3852
02:45:55,359 --> 02:45:58,040
Cyclones very

3853
02:45:58,399 --> 02:46:01,040
often so so people say that the reason

3854
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:02,520
why there's been no floods in our town

3855
02:46:02,520 --> 02:46:06,399
ever is because she's protected us now

3856
02:46:06,399 --> 02:46:07,840
many people may have different opinions

3857
02:46:07,840 --> 02:46:10,479
about it but I think as I grew up uh

3858
02:46:10,479 --> 02:46:14,359
around there um it just sort of became a

3859
02:46:14,359 --> 02:46:17,240
sense of Bel um uh that that got

3860
02:46:17,240 --> 02:46:20,240
captured now it may it may be rational

3861
02:46:20,240 --> 02:46:22,680
or not uh is a separate story but it's

3862
02:46:22,680 --> 02:46:26,080
just my personal belief as as an outcome

3863
02:46:26,080 --> 02:46:29,319
so for example uh many people uh used to

3864
02:46:29,319 --> 02:46:33,840
notice this I used to uh at work uh take

3865
02:46:33,840 --> 02:46:36,000
off my shoes and go inside for the

3866
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:38,240
longest time and I at some point of time

3867
02:46:38,240 --> 02:46:40,560
I changed it I think 3 4 years back but

3868
02:46:40,560 --> 02:46:43,359
it's for the longest time uh people used

3869
02:46:43,359 --> 02:46:45,359
to sort of there used to be a joke that

3870
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:47,880
you know he's at work by just noticing

3871
02:46:47,880 --> 02:46:49,040
that the shoes are

3872
02:46:49,040 --> 02:46:52,160
outside so um so that so but that's I

3873
02:46:52,160 --> 02:46:53,720
think that's deeply personal to me I

3874
02:46:53,720 --> 02:46:54,880
think it's probably the first time I'm

3875
02:46:54,880 --> 02:46:56,680
talking about it at all but uh it's

3876
02:46:56,680 --> 02:46:58,279
deeply personal to me I don't think I

3877
02:46:58,279 --> 02:47:00,520
impose it on anyone it's everybody's own

3878
02:47:00,520 --> 02:47:03,439
choice frankly but it's just something I

3879
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:08,000
personally believe in but the clarity in

3880
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:09,800
in the manner that you're articulating

3881
02:47:09,800 --> 02:47:11,160
is very

3882
02:47:11,160 --> 02:47:15,279
refreshing cuz you're not being defens

3883
02:47:15,279 --> 02:47:19,520
Ive or aggressive in your stance but

3884
02:47:19,520 --> 02:47:22,279
you're still being very concise and

3885
02:47:22,279 --> 02:47:24,399
clear I think at the end of the day

3886
02:47:24,399 --> 02:47:26,680
that's all one can hope for it but start

3887
02:47:26,680 --> 02:47:28,920
from childhood so let's get to know you

3888
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:31,960
like we got to know them you're not

3889
02:47:38,800 --> 02:47:41,120
convicted no but look I'm I'm really

3890
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:42,640
enjoying this format right I think it's

3891
02:47:42,640 --> 02:47:45,040
just so refreshing to not just go

3892
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:47,520
through what nikil said is a rehearsed

3893
02:47:47,520 --> 02:47:50,000
part and just sort of quote through the

3894
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:52,279
uh like just get to know individually

3895
02:47:52,279 --> 02:47:53,960
and and so on so I I I really enjoyed

3896
02:47:53,960 --> 02:47:55,479
listening to both of you and your

3897
02:47:55,479 --> 02:47:58,600
stories so I grew up

3898
02:47:58,600 --> 02:48:01,200
um I was born in a place called bisam

3899
02:48:01,200 --> 02:48:02,640
Kat most people wouldn't have heard

3900
02:48:02,640 --> 02:48:05,560
about it it's a uh Village in the Rara

3901
02:48:05,560 --> 02:48:08,840
District where I lived after uh we have

3902
02:48:08,840 --> 02:48:10,760
four siblings and the youngest of the

3903
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:15,080
lot uh I.E the most loved um uh among

3904
02:48:15,080 --> 02:48:18,399
the siblings uh the eldest is almost 8

3905
02:48:18,399 --> 02:48:20,520
years older than me so eldest is a

3906
02:48:20,520 --> 02:48:23,920
sister um so there's quite a bit of age

3907
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:28,600
Gap um so uh you know and uh typically

3908
02:48:28,600 --> 02:48:32,040
um uh parents or especially mom but both

3909
02:48:32,040 --> 02:48:33,920
of them used to encourage better

3910
02:48:33,920 --> 02:48:37,640
education as a way of being able to

3911
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:40,319
graduate out of the town we grew up in

3912
02:48:40,319 --> 02:48:43,520
because in some way education is sort of

3913
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:45,359
uh Brahman family

3914
02:48:45,359 --> 02:48:50,040
no agal so Mar family but um grew up

3915
02:48:50,040 --> 02:48:53,319
with a very um odia kind of uh

3916
02:48:53,319 --> 02:48:55,520
attributes because multiple generations

3917
02:48:55,520 --> 02:48:57,520
of both Papa and Mom had grown up in

3918
02:48:57,520 --> 02:48:59,720
odisa my mom came from a village called

3919
02:48:59,720 --> 02:49:02,439
itam Marti near buar uh but but you know

3920
02:49:02,439 --> 02:49:03,760
I think there when I when I used to

3921
02:49:03,760 --> 02:49:05,319
speak to other people saying how long

3922
02:49:05,319 --> 02:49:07,800
has this family been here they say that

3923
02:49:07,800 --> 02:49:09,880
for as long as we can remember right

3924
02:49:09,880 --> 02:49:11,920
like even the oldest of people so I

3925
02:49:11,920 --> 02:49:13,520
don't know how but it just so happened

3926
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:16,560
that they were there and and so I think

3927
02:49:16,560 --> 02:49:19,760
and the town is small so everybody sort

3928
02:49:19,760 --> 02:49:21,880
of knows each other right like almost

3929
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:23,439
every family every individual will know

3930
02:49:23,439 --> 02:49:25,960
each other not there's no concept of

3931
02:49:25,960 --> 02:49:28,399
like somebody lives in the place and you

3932
02:49:28,399 --> 02:49:32,000
don't know who that person is

3933
02:49:33,160 --> 02:49:37,439
so is an alien who's alien National not

3934
02:49:37,439 --> 02:49:38,840
alien in the sense of an alien like you

3935
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:42,640
know us forms are you an alien so I

3936
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:46,160
think that so I think um uh Elder three

3937
02:49:46,160 --> 02:49:48,319
siblings are like Asian parents dream

3938
02:49:48,319 --> 02:49:51,359
engineering business school good job all

3939
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:53,760
the other ticks right like marriage

3940
02:49:53,760 --> 02:49:56,720
children and and and all the tick

3941
02:49:56,720 --> 02:50:00,560
marks um and I was quite inspired by my

3942
02:50:00,560 --> 02:50:03,279
elder sister what did your parents do so

3943
02:50:03,279 --> 02:50:05,600
Mom was a homemaker Papa had a small

3944
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:08,399
shop initially uh where he would sell

3945
02:50:08,399 --> 02:50:11,600
like uh grocery products and so on uh

3946
02:50:11,600 --> 02:50:14,279
but later he uh joined U road

3947
02:50:14,279 --> 02:50:17,640
construction company as a manager uh in

3948
02:50:17,640 --> 02:50:22,479
in that company so anyway I think

3949
02:50:22,840 --> 02:50:25,439
um growing up I was more the rebel

3950
02:50:25,439 --> 02:50:27,800
relative to the uh other three kids

3951
02:50:27,800 --> 02:50:30,239
because of so much love one son oldest

3952
02:50:30,239 --> 02:50:32,880
sister middle so eldest is a sister

3953
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:34,840
second is also a sister third is a

3954
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:37,040
brother who's three and a half years

3955
02:50:37,040 --> 02:50:39,239
older than me and I'm the fourth so do

3956
02:50:39,239 --> 02:50:41,200
you work with any of them no so the

3957
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:44,160
eldest sister works for one of uh the

3958
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:47,279
subsidiar of S&P mhm second sister

3959
02:50:47,279 --> 02:50:51,239
standard in po yes uh the rating agency

3960
02:50:51,239 --> 02:50:53,520
the rating agencies one of their U you

3961
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:55,080
companies required what are they doing

3962
02:50:55,080 --> 02:50:57,600
giving India such bad rating look I

3963
02:50:57,600 --> 02:51:00,760
think uh it's a big problem we are also

3964
02:51:00,760 --> 02:51:03,560
rated by moodies and fit same and what

3965
02:51:03,560 --> 02:51:06,359
is it now Double B minus I think we are

3966
02:51:06,359 --> 02:51:08,760
b-rated now but no no I think we're BB

3967
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:10,520
minus as India oh sorry I was telling

3968
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:12,000
the oo

3969
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,319
rating so you know I'll tell you it's

3970
02:51:14,319 --> 02:51:16,439
such big problem we don't talk about it

3971
02:51:16,439 --> 02:51:20,239
enough every country's cost of borrowing

3972
02:51:20,239 --> 02:51:22,359
is dependent on how we are rated by

3973
02:51:22,359 --> 02:51:24,399
these three arbitrary

3974
02:51:24,399 --> 02:51:27,479
agencies criteria of rting six are

3975
02:51:27,479 --> 02:51:31,520
quantitative in nature like uh GDP rate

3976
02:51:31,520 --> 02:51:34,640
fiscal deficit inflation past track

3977
02:51:34,640 --> 02:51:37,600
record of servicing debt the other 10 or

3978
02:51:37,600 --> 02:51:40,720
11 parameters are arbitrary in nature

3979
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:43,040
it's more coming around perception and

3980
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:46,120
stuff like that and at Triple B minus

3981
02:51:46,120 --> 02:51:47,760
correct me if I'm wrong later but I

3982
02:51:47,760 --> 02:51:50,600
think it's Triple B minus now our cost

3983
02:51:50,600 --> 02:51:53,239
of borrowing is higher than countries

3984
02:51:53,239 --> 02:51:55,600
which are oneth our size let's say

3985
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:58,120
kazakistan has the same rating as us or

3986
02:51:58,120 --> 02:51:59,960
slightly lower or

3987
02:51:59,960 --> 02:52:02,200
whatever slightly better rating let's

3988
02:52:02,200 --> 02:52:04,239
assume kazakistan has better than us I

3989
02:52:04,239 --> 02:52:05,319
don't think they do I think they're

3990
02:52:05,319 --> 02:52:07,760
slightly below us in the table if

3991
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:10,239
they're able to borrow money at 5% for

3992
02:52:10,239 --> 02:52:13,960
infra projects building roads train

3993
02:52:13,960 --> 02:52:17,160
Airport whatever we land up borrowing at

3994
02:52:17,160 --> 02:52:20,640
62% a 20year term loan if you're

3995
02:52:20,640 --> 02:52:23,560
borrowing 10,000 cror in reality that

3996
02:52:23,560 --> 02:52:25,279
these numbers are significantly larger

3997
02:52:25,279 --> 02:52:27,880
than 10,000 when we are paying back at

3998
02:52:27,880 --> 02:52:31,640
the end of 20 years with the dollar this

3999
02:52:31,640 --> 02:52:34,000
10,000 we are paying back maybe 25,000

4000
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:37,760
they are paying back 17 18,000 that tiny

4001
02:52:37,760 --> 02:52:39,720
difference in rating

4002
02:52:39,720 --> 02:52:43,040
changes a cost of infra significantly

4003
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:45,080
and it is not just for the country right

4004
02:52:45,080 --> 02:52:47,239
it's also for corporations who whose

4005
02:52:47,239 --> 02:52:49,319
source of income is India so if you are

4006
02:52:49,319 --> 02:52:51,880
an Indian Corporation you may be like

4007
02:52:51,880 --> 02:52:55,720
any big company you don't get a a rating

4008
02:52:55,720 --> 02:52:58,439
because your Sovereign itself is not

4009
02:52:58,439 --> 02:53:00,920
rated enough but this is something we

4010
02:53:00,920 --> 02:53:04,040
all need to make noise about like U I

4011
02:53:04,040 --> 02:53:06,120
think what these three agencies together

4012
02:53:06,120 --> 02:53:08,399
are doing is extremely unfair and bad

4013
02:53:08,399 --> 02:53:10,479
very detrimental to the long-term growth

4014
02:53:10,479 --> 02:53:12,160
of India going back I think the eldest

4015
02:53:12,160 --> 02:53:14,040
sister has sort of been a s so I was

4016
02:53:14,040 --> 02:53:16,560
coming to everyone the second one uh is

4017
02:53:16,560 --> 02:53:19,479
now between jobs uh she's left uh

4018
02:53:19,479 --> 02:53:21,239
cognizant and because she's not joined

4019
02:53:21,239 --> 02:53:22,920
I'll not share but she's gone to a moved

4020
02:53:22,920 --> 02:53:26,279
to a consulting company uh elder brother

4021
02:53:26,279 --> 02:53:27,640
works for M

4022
02:53:27,640 --> 02:53:30,840
tree uh and I'm the uh fourth one how

4023
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:33,920
have the equations between the siblings

4024
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:38,359
changed because you are such an outlier

4025
02:53:38,359 --> 02:53:41,200
today equation among siblings how are

4026
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:44,000
you guys growing up and how are you now

4027
02:53:44,000 --> 02:53:45,920
look I I think growing up essentially

4028
02:53:45,920 --> 02:53:48,439
the there was a unique uh perspective

4029
02:53:48,439 --> 02:53:50,640
where the eldest sister was like a

4030
02:53:50,640 --> 02:53:52,560
little mom of sorts right because the

4031
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:55,800
age difference was so high and she was

4032
02:53:55,800 --> 02:53:58,239
sort of in our family the first women

4033
02:53:58,239 --> 02:54:01,319
who uh you know she was among uh the top

4034
02:54:01,319 --> 02:54:03,840
rankers in her school when she graduated

4035
02:54:03,840 --> 02:54:06,040
out of 10th like the overachiever uh

4036
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:08,319
gazel right so she was the first one who

4037
02:54:08,319 --> 02:54:11,160
went to engineering school uh she got a

4038
02:54:11,160 --> 02:54:16,040
job uh at TCS so like our dreams at

4039
02:54:16,040 --> 02:54:18,640
least my dreams where this kind of

4040
02:54:18,640 --> 02:54:20,560
villages you explain you are coming from

4041
02:54:20,560 --> 02:54:22,439
or District or taluk I don't know how do

4042
02:54:22,439 --> 02:54:25,640
you how do your parents even think to

4043
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:27,680
educate all of you with such

4044
02:54:27,680 --> 02:54:31,239
high pedigree I

4045
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:34,239
mean is one

4046
02:54:34,239 --> 02:54:38,960
basic flying out all four no so and I

4047
02:54:38,960 --> 02:54:40,560
think a large part of it I think is

4048
02:54:40,560 --> 02:54:42,880
driven by as much as my parents I would

4049
02:54:42,880 --> 02:54:45,319
give credit to the eldest sister also so

4050
02:54:45,319 --> 02:54:48,479
because she pursued that path and

4051
02:54:48,479 --> 02:54:50,000
everyone followed then every like it

4052
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:51,840
basically became like a little bit of

4053
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:53,760
and every Elder and younger sibling will

4054
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:56,000
relate with this if your Elder sibling

4055
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:57,720
got through good grades in your class

4056
02:54:57,720 --> 02:55:00,040
and graduated and if the same class

4057
02:55:00,040 --> 02:55:01,880
teachers there they'll say look at your

4058
02:55:01,880 --> 02:55:04,479
elder sister or brother they did so well

4059
02:55:04,479 --> 02:55:07,120
and like what are you doing so it sort

4060
02:55:07,120 --> 02:55:08,800
of becomes a little bit of a pure

4061
02:55:08,800 --> 02:55:11,319
pressure right so I think she for the

4062
02:55:11,319 --> 02:55:13,880
first time I think um I think I was

4063
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:16,399
still in my junior or middle school

4064
02:55:16,399 --> 02:55:17,840
between somewhere between third and

4065
02:55:17,840 --> 02:55:20,439
fifth grade and she had just gotten into

4066
02:55:20,439 --> 02:55:24,439
her um engineering school first year and

4067
02:55:24,439 --> 02:55:26,120
she had what was the entrepreneurship

4068
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:28,120
Fest so she went to bampur which is a

4069
02:55:28,120 --> 02:55:30,680
place in urisa it's a bigger town uh for

4070
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:31,800
her engineering

4071
02:55:31,800 --> 02:55:34,479
schooling so she came back during her

4072
02:55:34,479 --> 02:55:37,120
break and she comes and says uh we had

4073
02:55:37,120 --> 02:55:39,920
an entrepreneurship Fest M I had no idea

4074
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:42,040
what that word meant M so that was the

4075
02:55:42,040 --> 02:55:44,720
first time I figured that that there is

4076
02:55:44,720 --> 02:55:47,840
this new word being eldest sister like

4077
02:55:47,840 --> 02:55:50,479
mother figure the other two yeah so I

4078
02:55:50,479 --> 02:55:52,479
think the younger sister second sister

4079
02:55:52,479 --> 02:55:56,800
was little bit like the

4080
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:00,800
um person you create trouble with right

4081
02:56:00,800 --> 02:56:03,640
like you know uh were you naughty I I

4082
02:56:03,640 --> 02:56:06,080
was quite naughty I know I know of some

4083
02:56:06,080 --> 02:56:07,319
of the naughty things You' have done as

4084
02:56:07,319 --> 02:56:10,040
an adult but think dig a Little Deeper

4085
02:56:10,040 --> 02:56:11,560
as a child I have no idea what you're

4086
02:56:11,560 --> 02:56:13,359
talking about I would want to know

4087
02:56:13,359 --> 02:56:14,880
what's that

4088
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:18,080
take deeper as a child and the brother

4089
02:56:18,080 --> 02:56:19,600
brother

4090
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:25,120
um it was a mix of uh I would say

4091
02:56:25,120 --> 02:56:28,800
um learning and also that one sibling

4092
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:30,640
that you fight a lot with that's a

4093
02:56:30,640 --> 02:56:32,960
combination right so I think so for

4094
02:56:32,960 --> 02:56:37,840
example uh my uh love for sports started

4095
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:40,160
with him uh because he and his friends

4096
02:56:40,160 --> 02:56:42,800
would play sports and I wanted to be a

4097
02:56:42,800 --> 02:56:44,680
part of the group this again is

4098
02:56:44,680 --> 02:56:45,920
something I hear from a lot of

4099
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:47,040
successful

4100
02:56:47,040 --> 02:56:50,279
entrepreneurs some affiliation to sports

4101
02:56:50,279 --> 02:56:51,920
I've never been able to figure out what

4102
02:56:51,920 --> 02:56:53,840
the connection is but actually even when

4103
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:56,800
we recruit people uh we uh try and

4104
02:56:56,800 --> 02:56:58,800
recruit um people who have been good in

4105
02:56:58,800 --> 02:57:00,800
sports especially why is that do they do

4106
02:57:00,800 --> 02:57:03,399
better at they do very well with us

4107
02:57:03,399 --> 02:57:05,040
there two three reasons why I have

4108
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:07,560
deciphered the outcome the first is

4109
02:57:07,560 --> 02:57:09,960
especially we P we'd like to get people

4110
02:57:09,960 --> 02:57:12,080
from team sports so we believe that

4111
02:57:12,080 --> 02:57:13,840
their ability to work with other people

4112
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:15,399
in make sure that the team wins rather

4113
02:57:15,399 --> 02:57:17,520
than individual is better pursuit of

4114
02:57:17,520 --> 02:57:19,680
Excellence because in sports you are

4115
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:21,880
competitive you want to win uh you don't

4116
02:57:21,880 --> 02:57:24,840
want to um sort of be average as as an

4117
02:57:24,840 --> 02:57:27,359
outcome would you say Clarity of thought

4118
02:57:27,359 --> 02:57:29,800
important for an entrepreneur I think CL

4119
02:57:29,800 --> 02:57:31,960
like I call myself in a company Chief

4120
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:35,239
Clarity officer I think fundamentally

4121
02:57:35,239 --> 02:57:36,960
one of the biggest challenges I think

4122
02:57:36,960 --> 02:57:38,359
that's probably the similar word of

4123
02:57:38,359 --> 02:57:40,600
rigid that you were saying I think

4124
02:57:40,600 --> 02:57:44,600
having a clear answer versus saying that

4125
02:57:44,600 --> 02:57:46,840
um I don't know like I don't know how

4126
02:57:46,840 --> 02:57:48,399
it's going to come and let's derive it

4127
02:57:48,399 --> 02:57:50,560
out of 20 other things and or whatever

4128
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:52,640
people are saying let's do it I think

4129
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:54,399
that fundamentally is different I would

4130
02:57:54,399 --> 02:57:56,520
say this proof for any leaders you can

4131
02:57:56,520 --> 02:57:58,080
be an entrepreneur I think he had that

4132
02:57:58,080 --> 02:58:00,239
to a certain he had that and even she to

4133
02:58:00,239 --> 02:58:01,920
some extent right like she said this is

4134
02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:03,359
the kind of product I want to BU so I

4135
02:58:03,359 --> 02:58:06,600
think that um so you say that some of or

4136
02:58:06,600 --> 02:58:09,160
most or whatever some of your decisions

4137
02:58:09,160 --> 02:58:11,160
also come by your gut and just without

4138
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:14,600
being a very derived formula let's sit

4139
02:58:14,600 --> 02:58:16,279
and get a calculation done or you just

4140
02:58:16,279 --> 02:58:18,239
feel I'm very clear it will happen and

4141
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:23,040
let's look I I think uh probably given

4142
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:24,680
today I've been hearing a lot of depth

4143
02:58:24,680 --> 02:58:26,760
in conversation I'll try and sort of go

4144
02:58:26,760 --> 02:58:28,800
a little bit deeper in in that construct

4145
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:31,439
right so I feel that most of my

4146
02:58:31,439 --> 02:58:34,520
decisions are uh genuinely actually a

4147
02:58:34,520 --> 02:58:38,800
derivation uh of many things but uh what

4148
02:58:38,800 --> 02:58:40,880
comes out at the end is the gut

4149
02:58:40,880 --> 02:58:43,520
feeling um so uh I think how would you

4150
02:58:43,520 --> 02:58:45,600
define gut gut the word so so in my view

4151
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:48,239
the gut feeling is a summation of

4152
02:58:48,239 --> 02:58:52,880
experiences I have had um um uh good or

4153
02:58:52,880 --> 02:58:56,200
bad uh but I have gone through some

4154
02:58:56,200 --> 02:58:57,800
experiences where I have learned that

4155
02:58:57,800 --> 02:59:00,160
well this works for me and this doesn't

4156
02:59:00,160 --> 02:59:02,439
work for me and sometimes what works for

4157
02:59:02,439 --> 02:59:05,120
me may not work for anyone else and what

4158
02:59:05,120 --> 02:59:08,399
works for others may not work for me and

4159
02:59:08,399 --> 02:59:11,239
I'm very comfortable with that I have no

4160
02:59:11,239 --> 02:59:13,200
uh formo of saying that well it works

4161
02:59:13,200 --> 02:59:14,439
for someone else

4162
02:59:14,439 --> 02:59:16,479
I'm I have a interest to learn why it

4163
02:59:16,479 --> 02:59:20,399
worked for others but uh I don't have um

4164
02:59:20,399 --> 02:59:22,640
the the so that's that's what I sort of

4165
02:59:22,640 --> 02:59:26,520
Define gut as uh from my perspective um

4166
02:59:26,520 --> 02:59:29,239
and I think being cont like it's sort of

4167
02:59:29,239 --> 02:59:31,439
it means that you have to be contrarian

4168
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:33,200
uh I feel being contrarian is the other

4169
02:59:33,200 --> 02:59:34,800
thing that as an entrepreneur is very

4170
02:59:34,800 --> 02:59:36,920
valuable right like you have to be able

4171
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:38,720
to sort of have an opinion which maybe

4172
02:59:38,720 --> 02:59:41,840
the average people around you do not um

4173
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:45,840
and basically mass is generally wrong

4174
02:59:48,359 --> 02:59:49,920
relative

4175
02:59:49,920 --> 02:59:52,880
basically what everybody else believes

4176
02:59:52,880 --> 02:59:55,399
you don't have to believe maybe that's

4177
02:59:55,399 --> 02:59:57,120
that means the same thing that is a

4178
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:58,920
startup right yeah yeah absolutely I

4179
02:59:58,920 --> 03:00:00,200
think the startup is fundamentally

4180
03:00:00,200 --> 03:00:01,600
saying that what everybody so

4181
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:03,239
fundamentally you have to build

4182
03:00:03,239 --> 03:00:05,640
something which is against convention if

4183
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:07,399
it is convention the incumbent will

4184
03:00:07,399 --> 03:00:08,880
likely do it better by virtue of

4185
03:00:08,880 --> 03:00:11,319
experience and time yeah yeah and the M

4186
03:00:11,319 --> 03:00:14,279
of capital yeah yeah absolutely

4187
03:00:14,279 --> 03:00:17,040
absolutely so I think going back right I

4188
03:00:17,040 --> 03:00:19,560
think uh uh my trist with

4189
03:00:19,560 --> 03:00:21,160
entrepreneurship or the first word came

4190
03:00:21,160 --> 03:00:22,600
there before that my elder sister used

4191
03:00:22,600 --> 03:00:24,960
to say that she wanted to be a pilot so

4192
03:00:24,960 --> 03:00:26,160
when people would ask me what do you

4193
03:00:26,160 --> 03:00:27,279
want to be I used to say I want to be a

4194
03:00:27,279 --> 03:00:29,279
pilot even I used to say that as a kid

4195
03:00:29,279 --> 03:00:34,439
right yeah stupid astronaut I I had no

4196
03:00:35,560 --> 03:00:40,670
[Laughter]

4197
03:00:41,960 --> 03:00:45,720
idea if she's saying it

4198
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:50,800
I tried to figure out from the

4199
03:00:50,800 --> 03:00:52,279
dictionary what it

4200
03:00:52,279 --> 03:00:54,520
meant I started saying I want to be an

4201
03:00:54,520 --> 03:00:57,239
entrepreneur so my rebellious nature was

4202
03:00:57,239 --> 03:00:59,680
this that I tried to sort of be

4203
03:00:59,680 --> 03:01:01,640
different contrarian this is again

4204
03:01:01,640 --> 03:01:03,439
something which is common to a lot of

4205
03:01:03,439 --> 03:01:05,840
successful entrepreneurs Rebel often

4206
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:09,359
Without a Cause yeah often without a c I

4207
03:01:09,359 --> 03:01:11,640
think isn't it it's more a lot of

4208
03:01:11,640 --> 03:01:15,359
startups nature only

4209
03:01:15,359 --> 03:01:17,359
this all coming coming down to the same

4210
03:01:17,359 --> 03:01:19,479
thing Rebel contrarian against

4211
03:01:19,479 --> 03:01:21,920
convention anti-incumbent

4212
03:01:21,920 --> 03:01:24,800
right same thought absolutely absolutely

4213
03:01:24,800 --> 03:01:25,880
and I think where does the

4214
03:01:25,880 --> 03:01:27,520
rebelliousness come from was it

4215
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:29,359
rebelling against your parents in the

4216
03:01:29,359 --> 03:01:31,840
early days or what they wanted you to do

4217
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:34,920
no I think um quite the contrary

4218
03:01:34,920 --> 03:01:37,760
actually my parents um relatively they

4219
03:01:37,760 --> 03:01:39,239
felt that the Elder three children had

4220
03:01:39,239 --> 03:01:43,120
done so all right that they in some way

4221
03:01:43,120 --> 03:01:45,960
um also motivated to become me to become

4222
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:47,319
slightly more rebellious like they were

4223
03:01:47,319 --> 03:01:50,279
generally more comfortable with me doing

4224
03:01:50,279 --> 03:01:52,319
things which they were absolutely not

4225
03:01:52,319 --> 03:01:53,520
comfortable with the Elder three

4226
03:01:53,520 --> 03:01:55,399
children which is probably also the

4227
03:01:55,399 --> 03:01:58,160
reason I never stole right like where

4228
03:01:58,160 --> 03:02:00,720
basically if I asked for it often they

4229
03:02:00,720 --> 03:02:02,880
would give me uh which was not the case

4230
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:06,680
for my Elder Elder siblings so

4231
03:02:06,680 --> 03:02:09,319
uh and and I think I'm truly thankful to

4232
03:02:09,319 --> 03:02:10,560
that extent like I feel like if I was

4233
03:02:10,560 --> 03:02:12,640
probably just born as a third child i'

4234
03:02:12,640 --> 03:02:15,439
would not be who I am i' I I'd be who I

4235
03:02:15,439 --> 03:02:17,840
am only because I'm the youngest of the

4236
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:20,000
lot I generally middle kids are more

4237
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:21,960
rebellious cuz they have to set

4238
03:02:21,960 --> 03:02:24,880
themselves apart makes sense the top and

4239
03:02:24,880 --> 03:02:27,920
bottom organically get attention as long

4240
03:02:27,920 --> 03:02:29,680
as they know the last one in their

4241
03:02:29,680 --> 03:02:32,439
surpris like for example even then the

4242
03:02:32,439 --> 03:02:34,160
middle ones are still the rebellious at

4243
03:02:34,160 --> 03:02:36,560
one point of time principal said because

4244
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:38,720
he jumped the fence and came late da d

4245
03:02:38,720 --> 03:02:41,760
da for 7 days he can't come to school

4246
03:02:41,760 --> 03:02:45,000
like if any of my Elder siblings had got

4247
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:48,359
that uh decision from the principal I

4248
03:02:48,359 --> 03:02:51,200
think uh they were up for

4249
03:02:51,200 --> 03:02:55,720
like lot of P Dart uh there was no

4250
03:02:55,720 --> 03:02:59,040
coming back from it like for me it was

4251
03:02:59,040 --> 03:03:02,000
like you know Mom sat me down she said

4252
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:04,279
you shouldn't do this Dad said he's a

4253
03:03:04,279 --> 03:03:09,359
young kid happens so I felt you know I'm

4254
03:03:09,359 --> 03:03:11,680
I'm I should take full advantage of it

4255
03:03:11,680 --> 03:03:13,760
and and be as rebellious as I can so

4256
03:03:13,760 --> 03:03:16,080
great communication with your parents

4257
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:17,880
good communication with parents I think

4258
03:03:17,880 --> 03:03:22,000
more with Papa uh but uh because Dad was

4259
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:24,359
more the person who said do whatever you

4260
03:03:24,359 --> 03:03:28,720
want to be um uh he uh but Mom was the

4261
03:03:28,720 --> 03:03:30,359
one who would possibly sort of be the

4262
03:03:30,359 --> 03:03:32,920
more uh like you have to study well like

4263
03:03:32,920 --> 03:03:34,920
if you don't do that you'll like be in

4264
03:03:34,920 --> 03:03:38,000
Rara and run like a pant shop uh right

4265
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:39,840
like so Mom would paint the

4266
03:03:39,840 --> 03:03:43,920
contradictions much more uh actively um

4267
03:03:43,920 --> 03:03:45,600
communication skills continue in

4268
03:03:45,600 --> 03:03:49,439
companies like in OU yes I think uh

4269
03:03:49,439 --> 03:03:51,279
that's a very critical one let me let me

4270
03:03:51,279 --> 03:03:54,359
rephrase that question if your

4271
03:03:54,359 --> 03:03:57,800
management is doing something that is

4272
03:03:57,800 --> 03:04:01,000
annoying you to on a scale of 1 to

4273
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,840
10 I might bring it up when it's 5 out

4274
03:04:03,840 --> 03:04:06,840
of 10 do you bring it up at 5 out of 10

4275
03:04:06,840 --> 03:04:09,960
2 out of 10 8 out of 10 how how quickly

4276
03:04:09,960 --> 03:04:10,920
do you

4277
03:04:10,920 --> 03:04:13,080
communicate I think the feedback loop is

4278
03:04:13,080 --> 03:04:16,080
or the communication Loop is quite quick

4279
03:04:16,080 --> 03:04:18,560
um I would now annoying the magnitude is

4280
03:04:18,560 --> 03:04:20,640
quite small yeah I'll just uh yeah I'll

4281
03:04:20,640 --> 03:04:23,120
just uh basically sort of uh swing it to

4282
03:04:23,120 --> 03:04:24,960
say allowing me may not be like there

4283
03:04:24,960 --> 03:04:26,640
the magnitude may be very high but

4284
03:04:26,640 --> 03:04:28,000
anything that I believe that is wrong

4285
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:30,479
for the company or wrong for the um role

4286
03:04:30,479 --> 03:04:32,479
or the purpose they're pursuing I think

4287
03:04:32,479 --> 03:04:34,520
I feel very comfortable to have a

4288
03:04:34,520 --> 03:04:35,920
one-on-one

4289
03:04:35,920 --> 03:04:39,239
conversation bring it up but along with

4290
03:04:39,239 --> 03:04:40,960
calling myself Chief Clarity officer I

4291
03:04:40,960 --> 03:04:43,080
consider myself also a solution officer

4292
03:04:43,080 --> 03:04:44,800
so I bring up the problem but I often

4293
03:04:44,800 --> 03:04:47,080
couple that with a solution uh but I

4294
03:04:47,080 --> 03:04:49,880
feel very comfortable in bringing up a a

4295
03:04:49,880 --> 03:04:53,239
conversation I feel while in my family

4296
03:04:53,239 --> 03:04:54,920
that was very valuable I think there was

4297
03:04:54,920 --> 03:04:56,920
one person who changed it for me I think

4298
03:04:56,920 --> 03:04:59,600
uh the person is beul Somaya at light

4299
03:04:59,600 --> 03:05:02,800
speed yeah so be invested in us

4300
03:05:02,800 --> 03:05:06,040
like they invest very fast H yeah like

4301
03:05:06,040 --> 03:05:08,200
they take no time at all they took a

4302
03:05:08,200 --> 03:05:10,319
long time that was different story back

4303
03:05:10,319 --> 03:05:12,359
there was one company we were reviewing

4304
03:05:12,359 --> 03:05:16,080
recently not name the company so we were

4305
03:05:16,080 --> 03:05:18,680
negotiating with the founder and he had

4306
03:05:18,680 --> 03:05:20,239
come to the office in the afternoon he

4307
03:05:20,239 --> 03:05:22,640
went to light speed at night he came

4308
03:05:22,640 --> 03:05:24,479
back to us in the next evening and he

4309
03:05:24,479 --> 03:05:26,800
said light speed signed the term sheet

4310
03:05:26,800 --> 03:05:29,680
light speed yeah no light speed has they

4311
03:05:29,680 --> 03:05:32,319
call themselves as a high conviction

4312
03:05:32,319 --> 03:05:33,840
investor so they say that we invest very

4313
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:35,120
little like they would invest in a year

4314
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:36,399
like four five companies or three four

4315
03:05:36,399 --> 03:05:38,399
companies but in the ones they believe

4316
03:05:38,399 --> 03:05:40,880
in they would move very very quickly but

4317
03:05:40,880 --> 03:05:42,600
with us they took longer I don't know

4318
03:05:42,600 --> 03:05:43,800
why maybe they took took longer to

4319
03:05:43,800 --> 03:05:47,399
believe but um I had so they invested

4320
03:05:47,399 --> 03:05:49,720
your self-deprecating nature is very

4321
03:05:49,720 --> 03:05:51,920
attractive do you think that also holds

4322
03:05:51,920 --> 03:05:55,319
Good in the work ecosystem cuz we are so

4323
03:05:55,319 --> 03:05:58,359
used to looking at people who are

4324
03:05:58,359 --> 03:06:00,880
embellishing thems

4325
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:03,760
constantly that that one startup which

4326
03:06:03,760 --> 03:06:05,960
comes to you and self deprecates becomes

4327
03:06:05,960 --> 03:06:08,359
a novelty do you think that works contan

4328
03:06:08,359 --> 03:06:10,439
mindset in a different manner yeah I

4329
03:06:10,439 --> 03:06:12,680
think in some way but I I have learned

4330
03:06:12,680 --> 03:06:14,319
that you know that the only way

4331
03:06:14,319 --> 03:06:18,680
especially um if you have a highly

4332
03:06:18,680 --> 03:06:21,120
talented management right who you want

4333
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:23,800
to retain for a long period of time

4334
03:06:23,800 --> 03:06:26,239
there is no other way uh you can work

4335
03:06:26,239 --> 03:06:29,080
with them rather than being absolutely

4336
03:06:29,080 --> 03:06:32,920
um absolutely straightforward honest

4337
03:06:32,920 --> 03:06:35,439
vulnerable uh with them and then because

4338
03:06:35,439 --> 03:06:37,239
you spend most of the time most people

4339
03:06:37,239 --> 03:06:38,720
don't recognize it but they spend more

4340
03:06:38,720 --> 03:06:39,840
time with their colleagues than with

4341
03:06:39,840 --> 03:06:42,479
their own families also so due to which

4342
03:06:42,479 --> 03:06:44,080
you basically become an average of the

4343
03:06:44,080 --> 03:06:45,840
people around you that's my favorite

4344
03:06:45,840 --> 03:06:47,239
line in the office I said I know you

4345
03:06:47,239 --> 03:06:49,880
more than your wife you spend 11 hours

4346
03:06:49,880 --> 03:06:52,520
here 10 hours here so to that extent but

4347
03:06:52,520 --> 03:06:55,640
I think um I feel personally that also

4348
03:06:55,640 --> 03:06:57,319
comes when you become truly comfortable

4349
03:06:57,319 --> 03:06:59,399
in your skin I think the reason why the

4350
03:06:59,399 --> 03:07:01,160
self embellishing character gets spilt

4351
03:07:01,160 --> 03:07:03,120
is because you genuinely have a sense of

4352
03:07:03,120 --> 03:07:04,359
insecurity where you feel like

4353
03:07:04,359 --> 03:07:07,319
self-deprecating nature

4354
03:07:10,479 --> 03:07:13,319
of you know what will it mean can I ask

4355
03:07:13,319 --> 03:07:15,319
you another question I'm sorry I'm

4356
03:07:15,319 --> 03:07:18,399
digressing as much retes and oo dissect

4357
03:07:18,399 --> 03:07:21,319
the two apart from each other retes the

4358
03:07:21,319 --> 03:07:23,680
kid rates the teenager rates the young

4359
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:25,359
adult ratesh at

4360
03:07:25,359 --> 03:07:27,520
30 what do you think are your

4361
03:07:27,520 --> 03:07:30,880
personality flaws and it's very core

4362
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:32,439
I've come back to this because we stole

4363
03:07:32,439 --> 03:07:34,080
money from our mother's purses you did

4364
03:07:34,080 --> 03:07:36,399
not so there must be something else that

4365
03:07:36,399 --> 03:07:39,640
we need to know the rebel in some way FL

4366
03:07:39,640 --> 03:07:42,239
no no I'll conclude that the rebel in

4367
03:07:42,239 --> 03:07:43,439
some way I think came out of a

4368
03:07:43,439 --> 03:07:48,359
personality flaw uh of trying uh new

4369
03:07:48,359 --> 03:07:52,840
things and the flaw in it is potentially

4370
03:07:52,840 --> 03:07:57,399
um lesser attention span um or lesser

4371
03:07:57,399 --> 03:08:00,640
Span in I give less time to something to

4372
03:08:00,640 --> 03:08:05,800
fully um uh Bake open right like

4373
03:08:05,800 --> 03:08:08,560
um I feel I tried to do too many things

4374
03:08:08,560 --> 03:08:11,040
in the early days of our company and I

4375
03:08:11,040 --> 03:08:13,640
feel when I fully decided that I'm

4376
03:08:13,640 --> 03:08:14,880
I'll ask you another question which

4377
03:08:14,880 --> 03:08:18,319
might help with this answer yeah think

4378
03:08:18,319 --> 03:08:20,920
of a kid I keep coming back to kids I

4379
03:08:20,920 --> 03:08:23,200
don't yes think of a no I agree with

4380
03:08:23,200 --> 03:08:25,600
that 3 to S I think that's when your um

4381
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:28,200
you know your your formation or

4382
03:08:28,200 --> 03:08:30,720
Foundation is individual is buil yeah

4383
03:08:30,720 --> 03:08:32,640
think of a kid

4384
03:08:32,640 --> 03:08:37,439
okay uh I'm in a room with a kid I put a

4385
03:08:37,439 --> 03:08:40,040
marshmallow in front of the kid I say

4386
03:08:40,040 --> 03:08:42,319
I'm going to go out of the room make a

4387
03:08:42,319 --> 03:08:45,200
phone call and come back into the room M

4388
03:08:45,200 --> 03:08:48,040
if the marshmallow in front of you I

4389
03:08:48,040 --> 03:08:50,359
tell the kid is still there when I come

4390
03:08:50,359 --> 03:08:52,920
back I will give you two

4391
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:54,760
marshmallows then you'll have two

4392
03:08:54,760 --> 03:08:56,399
instead of

4393
03:08:56,399 --> 03:09:00,080
one when people tested kids actually

4394
03:09:00,080 --> 03:09:03,120
they figured that 80% of kids are not

4395
03:09:03,120 --> 03:09:05,680
able to delay gratification until the

4396
03:09:05,680 --> 03:09:07,359
person goes out of the room and comes

4397
03:09:07,359 --> 03:09:10,960
back and they eat the marshmallow 80%

4398
03:09:10,960 --> 03:09:15,000
yeah and when they track the 20% of kids

4399
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:18,760
over a 15 20 30 40 year period they

4400
03:09:18,760 --> 03:09:20,120
figured there's

4401
03:09:20,120 --> 03:09:23,120
tangible evidence to prove that the kids

4402
03:09:23,120 --> 03:09:25,000
who were able to delay

4403
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:27,120
gratification turned out to be the most

4404
03:09:27,120 --> 03:09:29,439
successful when they grew up M do you

4405
03:09:29,439 --> 03:09:31,080
think not being able to delay

4406
03:09:31,080 --> 03:09:33,040
gratification could be a flaw in

4407
03:09:33,040 --> 03:09:35,560
you personally don't bias it on what I

4408
03:09:35,560 --> 03:09:37,359
have to say I'll tell you the two

4409
03:09:37,359 --> 03:09:39,399
personality traits which is confusing me

4410
03:09:39,399 --> 03:09:42,200
about this question I have very high

4411
03:09:42,200 --> 03:09:44,120
ability of delaying gratification in

4412
03:09:44,120 --> 03:09:46,239
terms of wealth creation for

4413
03:09:46,239 --> 03:09:50,600
instance um on the other hand I have

4414
03:09:50,600 --> 03:09:53,479
very low ability to delay

4415
03:09:53,479 --> 03:09:55,800
gratification in terms of beginning the

4416
03:09:55,800 --> 03:09:57,359
pursu that I wanted and I'll give

4417
03:09:57,359 --> 03:09:59,600
examples of both in a tangible way so

4418
03:09:59,600 --> 03:10:02,439
it'll explain this to you better I

4419
03:10:02,439 --> 03:10:04,239
genuinely fell in love with this idea

4420
03:10:04,239 --> 03:10:06,560
that you know I will go digitize small

4421
03:10:06,560 --> 03:10:09,239
hotels and I thought the time is now and

4422
03:10:09,239 --> 03:10:11,359
I said I'll do it now this is right

4423
03:10:11,359 --> 03:10:14,000
after 12th grade first Papa got to know

4424
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,239
and he tried to reason with me saying

4425
03:10:16,239 --> 03:10:17,160
that you

4426
03:10:17,160 --> 03:10:20,200
know get your college done and then do

4427
03:10:20,200 --> 03:10:22,760
this and I said you know I like I

4428
03:10:22,760 --> 03:10:25,080
genuinely believe the time is now and of

4429
03:10:25,080 --> 03:10:27,439
course Papa having better communication

4430
03:10:27,439 --> 03:10:29,520
he both of us then came up with what the

4431
03:10:29,520 --> 03:10:31,479
communication to Mom will be which

4432
03:10:31,479 --> 03:10:33,200
basically became all the kids in our

4433
03:10:33,200 --> 03:10:35,200
12th grade are taking a gap year

4434
03:10:35,200 --> 03:10:37,000
consider this the Gap year and if it

4435
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:38,439
doesn't work I'll move back so this is

4436
03:10:38,439 --> 03:10:40,080
where I did not deal

4437
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:43,319
gratification On The Other Extreme I

4438
03:10:43,319 --> 03:10:47,920
think uh probably just Soo is this year

4439
03:10:47,920 --> 03:10:49,840
completing 10 years so we are a we've

4440
03:10:49,840 --> 03:10:53,439
been around for some time probably until

4441
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:56,960
three or four years back uh I had a few

4442
03:10:56,960 --> 03:10:59,640
liks in my bank account M right you

4443
03:10:59,640 --> 03:11:01,239
never did secondary I never did

4444
03:11:01,239 --> 03:11:04,800
secondaries because uh the purpose and

4445
03:11:04,800 --> 03:11:07,080
the enthusiasm was so exciting that

4446
03:11:07,080 --> 03:11:09,359
nothing else mattered um in terms of

4447
03:11:09,359 --> 03:11:12,080
context so I think um there is a

4448
03:11:12,080 --> 03:11:14,960
conformity in me also I have I a unique

4449
03:11:14,960 --> 03:11:17,760
combination of rebellious and Conformity

4450
03:11:17,760 --> 03:11:19,720
so for example can I can I take away

4451
03:11:19,720 --> 03:11:22,720
from your last statement you're able to

4452
03:11:22,720 --> 03:11:25,760
delay gratification when it comes

4453
03:11:25,760 --> 03:11:28,960
to money paid out to you without

4454
03:11:28,960 --> 03:11:31,239
complicating how that sounds secondary

4455
03:11:31,239 --> 03:11:34,960
round but you find it harder to delay

4456
03:11:34,960 --> 03:11:38,680
gratification when it comes to growth or

4457
03:11:38,680 --> 03:11:42,600
when it comes to public perception I

4458
03:11:42,600 --> 03:11:45,000
think I think money paid out to me I'm

4459
03:11:45,000 --> 03:11:47,399
willing to delay gratification I'm

4460
03:11:47,399 --> 03:11:49,399
unable to delay gratification when it

4461
03:11:49,399 --> 03:11:52,680
comes to

4462
03:11:52,800 --> 03:11:56,560
um intellectual stimulation which comes

4463
03:11:56,560 --> 03:11:59,479
why I think uh you know solving problems

4464
03:11:59,479 --> 03:12:01,479
right I think finding same problem new

4465
03:12:01,479 --> 03:12:04,560
problems cuz once a problem is solved it

4466
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:06,520
becomes less intellectually stimulating

4467
03:12:06,520 --> 03:12:09,040
right yeah no which means new problems I

4468
03:12:09,040 --> 03:12:10,680
think which is which is the whole point

4469
03:12:10,680 --> 03:12:13,680
I was going back to right that uh for me

4470
03:12:13,680 --> 03:12:17,680
I last five years I had to change myself

4471
03:12:17,680 --> 03:12:19,840
fundamentally to try and make sure that

4472
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:21,800
every day I reviewed the same thing

4473
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:24,239
because businesses are inherently boring

4474
03:12:24,239 --> 03:12:25,800
at some level right so you have to make

4475
03:12:25,800 --> 03:12:28,399
sure that there's the 30% excitement

4476
03:12:28,399 --> 03:12:30,399
which is solving a new problem uh

4477
03:12:30,399 --> 03:12:32,880
creating a product feature or one of

4478
03:12:32,880 --> 03:12:35,720
those things but 70% of it is just Ops

4479
03:12:35,720 --> 03:12:37,399
right like doing the same job little bit

4480
03:12:37,399 --> 03:12:39,520
better every day um and that did not

4481
03:12:39,520 --> 03:12:40,960
come naturally to me I think I had to

4482
03:12:40,960 --> 03:12:43,439
train myself to become the that person

4483
03:12:43,439 --> 03:12:46,720
who do you emulate rates the person who

4484
03:12:46,720 --> 03:12:48,479
we all pick someone and do it

4485
03:12:48,479 --> 03:12:50,680
consciously and subconsciously I think

4486
03:12:50,680 --> 03:12:53,439
as a business person somebody who at

4487
03:12:53,439 --> 03:12:54,640
least over the last five years when I

4488
03:12:54,640 --> 03:12:56,560
said that I tried to transform myself

4489
03:12:56,560 --> 03:12:58,200
especially with the onset of covid or

4490
03:12:58,200 --> 03:13:00,279
around the four years maybe I think that

4491
03:13:00,279 --> 03:13:02,800
is UD kotak I think I feel like he's one

4492
03:13:02,800 --> 03:13:04,080
of those people again first generation

4493
03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:05,520
entrepreneur most people don't recognize

4494
03:13:05,520 --> 03:13:08,040
built a bank first

4495
03:13:08,040 --> 03:13:10,000
generation he king of delaying

4496
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:12,080
gratification yeah and you you sit with

4497
03:13:12,080 --> 03:13:14,760
him in the room there's a sense of like

4498
03:13:14,760 --> 03:13:19,239
and every time he begins inti

4499
03:13:22,239 --> 03:13:24,960
saying so he like there's just a sense

4500
03:13:24,960 --> 03:13:27,520
of when you begin the discussions with

4501
03:13:27,520 --> 03:13:31,040
him there's a sense of um like the world

4502
03:13:31,040 --> 03:13:32,160
may be

4503
03:13:32,160 --> 03:13:34,479
burning and he will represent that in

4504
03:13:34,479 --> 03:13:36,200
words but he would not emote it in

4505
03:13:36,200 --> 03:13:38,840
actions right I agree with you 100% but

4506
03:13:38,840 --> 03:13:41,000
if you have to derive something from

4507
03:13:41,000 --> 03:13:44,040
this for a 21y old we talking to

4508
03:13:44,040 --> 03:13:46,760
today what do you think people like UD

4509
03:13:46,760 --> 03:13:51,279
kotak his generation had that the 21y

4510
03:13:51,279 --> 03:13:53,359
old today is lacking which is relevant

4511
03:13:53,359 --> 03:13:55,800
to the world of today I would say three

4512
03:13:55,800 --> 03:14:00,840
things the first one is being absolutely

4513
03:14:00,840 --> 03:14:03,160
comfortable to make sure that when your

4514
03:14:03,160 --> 03:14:06,520
friends are sharing beautiful Instagram

4515
03:14:06,520 --> 03:14:09,439
stories of going to pubs restaurants or

4516
03:14:09,439 --> 03:14:10,920
very exciting

4517
03:14:10,920 --> 03:14:13,120
places um

4518
03:14:13,120 --> 03:14:16,560
you are pursuing things which are not

4519
03:14:16,560 --> 03:14:19,279
exciting and you sort of tend to believe

4520
03:14:19,279 --> 03:14:21,040
that it is because of your

4521
03:14:21,040 --> 03:14:22,640
circumstances would you say that's

4522
03:14:22,640 --> 03:14:24,200
delaying gratification that's delaying

4523
03:14:24,200 --> 03:14:25,439
gratification but I'm just trying to put

4524
03:14:25,439 --> 03:14:27,760
it going to going to a pub is instant

4525
03:14:27,760 --> 03:14:30,279
pleasure Center yes right yes there's

4526
03:14:30,279 --> 03:14:32,279
there's a psychologist who said a very

4527
03:14:32,279 --> 03:14:34,439
interesting thing what is the difference

4528
03:14:34,439 --> 03:14:36,560
between pleasure and

4529
03:14:36,560 --> 03:14:40,560
enjoyment pleasure is having that piece

4530
03:14:40,560 --> 03:14:42,920
of chocolate which has sugar in it

4531
03:14:42,920 --> 03:14:46,840
pleasure is having a beer maybe pleasure

4532
03:14:46,840 --> 03:14:47,960
becomes

4533
03:14:47,960 --> 03:14:51,760
enjoyment when there is a gap between

4534
03:14:51,760 --> 03:14:54,479
two pleasurable events and you add

4535
03:14:54,479 --> 03:14:57,120
memory to it memory happens by virtue of

4536
03:14:57,120 --> 03:15:00,680
adding a group around it yeah no I think

4537
03:15:00,680 --> 03:15:02,960
this um the other way to put it is if

4538
03:15:02,960 --> 03:15:05,160
you look at there's this Netflix

4539
03:15:05,160 --> 03:15:07,239
documentary which is I think it's called

4540
03:15:07,239 --> 03:15:09,560
the Blue lines or blue zones BL zones

4541
03:15:09,560 --> 03:15:10,720
blue zones right which talks about

4542
03:15:10,720 --> 03:15:12,920
longetivity and

4543
03:15:12,920 --> 03:15:15,359
longetivity has something similar which

4544
03:15:15,359 --> 03:15:17,840
talks about a sense of community

4545
03:15:17,840 --> 03:15:19,439
happiness but at the same time making

4546
03:15:19,439 --> 03:15:21,479
sure that your food habits Etc are sort

4547
03:15:21,479 --> 03:15:23,439
of not designed for short-term pleasure

4548
03:15:23,439 --> 03:15:25,199
but long-term enjoyment rather okay

4549
03:15:25,199 --> 03:15:28,120
delaying ratification not not succumbing

4550
03:15:28,120 --> 03:15:29,920
to the short-term Pleasures absolutely

4551
03:15:29,920 --> 03:15:33,640
and also not having to conform to

4552
03:15:33,640 --> 03:15:36,560
average people like average um uh pure

4553
03:15:36,560 --> 03:15:38,319
pressure around you right like I think

4554
03:15:38,319 --> 03:15:39,960
don't you think this generation has that

4555
03:15:39,960 --> 03:15:42,960
in check compared to UDOT in that

4556
03:15:42,960 --> 03:15:44,880
generation they were more conformist

4557
03:15:44,880 --> 03:15:47,800
than the 21 year olds of today I think

4558
03:15:47,800 --> 03:15:51,560
uh the 21 year olds uh have if I were to

4559
03:15:51,560 --> 03:15:53,840
uh reverse the word of uh Conformity

4560
03:15:53,840 --> 03:15:57,120
pure pressure to look the best on social

4561
03:15:57,120 --> 03:16:00,040
media to make sure they dress the best

4562
03:16:00,040 --> 03:16:01,560
to make sure that they have the best

4563
03:16:01,560 --> 03:16:03,199
number of posts to make sure they have

4564
03:16:03,199 --> 03:16:04,560
the most number of likes so you would

4565
03:16:04,560 --> 03:16:06,880
say social pressure social social

4566
03:16:06,880 --> 03:16:08,199
pressure that's probably a better word

4567
03:16:08,199 --> 03:16:12,359
to it um but I think to avoid it to

4568
03:16:12,359 --> 03:16:13,960
significant extent is a very critical

4569
03:16:13,960 --> 03:16:16,960
thing because that pressure is so high

4570
03:16:16,960 --> 03:16:19,960
and so noisy today that it can end up

4571
03:16:19,960 --> 03:16:21,880
pushing you towards doing things with no

4572
03:16:21,880 --> 03:16:24,560
patience no patience underline if that

4573
03:16:24,560 --> 03:16:25,840
is there at least they can handle all

4574
03:16:25,840 --> 03:16:28,720
that because and I grew up in like

4575
03:16:28,720 --> 03:16:30,399
similar generation now I think 10 years

4576
03:16:30,399 --> 03:16:32,640
back is already a generation apart but I

4577
03:16:32,640 --> 03:16:35,399
think 10 years back when I was growing

4578
03:16:35,399 --> 03:16:38,479
up uh people around me would look at me

4579
03:16:38,479 --> 03:16:41,920
and say that guy's a dock right like

4580
03:16:41,920 --> 03:16:45,000
absolutely dock studying all the time

4581
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:46,680
doing business who does this when they

4582
03:16:46,680 --> 03:16:47,840
are

4583
03:16:47,840 --> 03:16:52,800
19 and if you uh get bothered by

4584
03:16:52,800 --> 03:16:55,600
it you will lose in my view the number

4585
03:16:55,600 --> 03:16:57,279
one thing that it takes to get an

4586
03:16:57,279 --> 03:16:59,160
entrepreneurial success or any success

4587
03:16:59,160 --> 03:17:00,960
which is perseverance like being at it

4588
03:17:00,960 --> 03:17:02,640
for long periods of time because there

4589
03:17:02,640 --> 03:17:04,840
there are so many reasons to give up no

4590
03:17:04,840 --> 03:17:06,760
right should not get one one layer under

4591
03:17:06,760 --> 03:17:09,120
your skin so for example like I told one

4592
03:17:09,120 --> 03:17:11,199
of my

4593
03:17:11,199 --> 03:17:13,319
friends

4594
03:17:13,319 --> 03:17:15,840
is Metro

4595
03:17:16,479 --> 03:17:20,439
station in Delhi bti is like um a

4596
03:17:20,439 --> 03:17:23,080
thatched roof uh room at the top of a

4597
03:17:23,080 --> 03:17:24,160
house so that's where I used to live

4598
03:17:24,160 --> 03:17:25,720
when I first moved like most people who

4599
03:17:25,720 --> 03:17:28,439
mov to Delhi live there

4600
03:17:28,439 --> 03:17:31,279
so but I had never told him it's ATI

4601
03:17:31,279 --> 03:17:35,359
because you don't tell a normal I just

4602
03:17:38,760 --> 03:17:42,600
said right like a usual kit this was a

4603
03:17:42,600 --> 03:17:44,560
wealthy kid there were some kids I was

4604
03:17:44,560 --> 03:17:45,920
friend not when I was starting my

4605
03:17:45,920 --> 03:17:48,720
business in Delhi a usual kid would have

4606
03:17:48,720 --> 03:17:49,680
gotten so

4607
03:17:49,680 --> 03:17:51,439
bothered that they would have stopped

4608
03:17:51,439 --> 03:17:54,160
calling people to meet themselves but

4609
03:17:54,160 --> 03:17:56,000
for me it was very comfortable I was

4610
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:57,560
very okay with saying that people will

4611
03:17:57,560 --> 03:17:58,800
say this to

4612
03:17:58,800 --> 03:18:02,920
me and if I do well in life it'll be all

4613
03:18:02,920 --> 03:18:04,880
right if not then this is the means I

4614
03:18:04,880 --> 03:18:08,040
have so being okay to let go of social

4615
03:18:08,040 --> 03:18:10,000
pressure is what I would encourage and I

4616
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:11,960
also got bothered by it a lot of times

4617
03:18:11,960 --> 03:18:16,040
was when I was 19 19 but I also got

4618
03:18:16,040 --> 03:18:19,439
bothered by it but I

4619
03:18:21,640 --> 03:18:25,040
recognized what can be

4620
03:18:35,190 --> 03:18:41,120
[Music]

4621
03:18:41,120 --> 03:18:44,120
wor

4622
03:18:45,439 --> 03:18:49,040
they were similar Rebels Without a

4623
03:18:49,880 --> 03:18:53,800
Cause so UD kotak you said so first is

4624
03:18:53,800 --> 03:18:55,640
delay gratification delay gratification

4625
03:18:55,640 --> 03:18:58,520
second is not social no social PR as

4626
03:18:58,520 --> 03:18:59,720
indifference is the new cool

4627
03:18:59,720 --> 03:19:01,960
indifference is the new cool absolutely

4628
03:19:01,960 --> 03:19:05,399
and the third one is I think a sense of

4629
03:19:05,399 --> 03:19:09,600
humility and humility in decisions which

4630
03:19:09,600 --> 03:19:12,120
uh can be very large so for example now

4631
03:19:12,120 --> 03:19:13,479
is when I meet young entrepr you think

4632
03:19:13,479 --> 03:19:16,040
humility is counterintuitive to

4633
03:19:16,040 --> 03:19:18,479
self-confidence which we established is

4634
03:19:18,479 --> 03:19:21,000
a prerequisite for someone looking to

4635
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,120
start up no I think they they are

4636
03:19:23,120 --> 03:19:25,720
independent uh strong characteristics I

4637
03:19:25,720 --> 03:19:27,399
think you can can you be self-confident

4638
03:19:27,399 --> 03:19:29,560
and humble yes you can be self-confident

4639
03:19:29,560 --> 03:19:32,279
give me a for instance so uh

4640
03:19:32,279 --> 03:19:35,760
self-confident would mean that I can

4641
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:39,359
build oo into a incredible success

4642
03:19:39,359 --> 03:19:42,239
humble is um it's the first time I'm

4643
03:19:42,239 --> 03:19:44,960
building a hotel business so um I don't

4644
03:19:44,960 --> 03:19:47,080
know what will go in this journey but I

4645
03:19:47,080 --> 03:19:49,600
will figure it out so I think that's at

4646
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:51,680
least that's my view but to the third

4647
03:19:51,680 --> 03:19:53,040
point will you add to the end of that

4648
03:19:53,040 --> 03:19:56,520
line can you help me his point of no ego

4649
03:19:56,520 --> 03:19:58,479
willing to bend your back absolutely

4650
03:19:58,479 --> 03:19:59,880
absolutely and I and I'll explain an

4651
03:19:59,880 --> 03:20:02,600
example with UD kotak's example right he

4652
03:20:02,600 --> 03:20:05,600
built a fantastic franchise um in his

4653
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:09,000
previous AAR before the bank M and he

4654
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:12,040
was so he started a um Bild discounting

4655
03:20:12,040 --> 03:20:14,800
business if I remember it

4656
03:20:14,800 --> 03:20:17,479
right he was okay to add the Mahindra

4657
03:20:17,479 --> 03:20:21,000
name to the bank mhm right he had built

4658
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:22,560
a big business he didn't need to do it

4659
03:20:22,560 --> 03:20:25,800
yeah but he was okay to do it nowadays

4660
03:20:25,800 --> 03:20:27,199
when I meet entrepreneurs who have just

4661
03:20:27,199 --> 03:20:29,840
started the business not all like 90% of

4662
03:20:29,840 --> 03:20:31,080
them like I'm surprised young

4663
03:20:31,080 --> 03:20:32,479
entrepreneurs can be so bright and they

4664
03:20:32,479 --> 03:20:34,040
have all these characteristics but

4665
03:20:34,040 --> 03:20:36,279
there's some people who have this sense

4666
03:20:36,279 --> 03:20:40,840
of saying that a sense of um superiority

4667
03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:43,399
that I have done so much already ready M

4668
03:20:43,399 --> 03:20:46,760
I think um for people in that generation

4669
03:20:46,760 --> 03:20:48,880
like him like Naran morti and various

4670
03:20:48,880 --> 03:20:51,840
others they built incredible businesses

4671
03:20:51,840 --> 03:20:54,800
but we're still able to accept that but

4672
03:20:54,800 --> 03:20:58,479
in comparison I'm still aring error and

4673
03:20:58,479 --> 03:21:00,560
I have to do a lot more and I think that

4674
03:21:00,560 --> 03:21:02,800
was that humility that allowed them to

4675
03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:04,560
become you know a bigger version of

4676
03:21:04,560 --> 03:21:06,479
themselves uh consistently they say

4677
03:21:06,479 --> 03:21:07,960
people who made a lot of money very

4678
03:21:07,960 --> 03:21:10,600
quickly often hate themselves in the

4679
03:21:10,600 --> 03:21:12,920
world so

4680
03:21:12,920 --> 03:21:14,840
subconsciously do

4681
03:21:14,840 --> 03:21:17,319
you often hate themselves and the world

4682
03:21:17,319 --> 03:21:19,199
try you find yourself or somewhere yeah

4683
03:21:19,199 --> 03:21:21,640
like deep

4684
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:25,840
down do don't know yeah I think uh I I

4685
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:27,439
interesting question though I'm in

4686
03:21:27,439 --> 03:21:30,439
absolute I I I like myself and you know

4687
03:21:30,439 --> 03:21:34,080
I try to uh do more to like myself

4688
03:21:34,080 --> 03:21:36,960
humility also allows you allows a lot of

4689
03:21:36,960 --> 03:21:40,319
common people to accept you on a very

4690
03:21:40,319 --> 03:21:42,479
easy approachable manner

4691
03:21:42,479 --> 03:21:45,600
otherwise hum honest in my be so

4692
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:48,319
surrounded with your own self and your

4693
03:21:48,319 --> 03:21:51,319
XYZ

4694
03:21:56,439 --> 03:21:58,439
humility but you should at the same time

4695
03:21:58,439 --> 03:22:01,279
be able to accept that their things

4696
03:22:01,279 --> 03:22:03,160
you other people who have done better

4697
03:22:03,160 --> 03:22:05,680
than you I want to understand

4698
03:22:05,680 --> 03:22:08,359
that that people who have made a lot of

4699
03:22:08,359 --> 03:22:10,960
money very quickly deep down hid

4700
03:22:10,960 --> 03:22:12,920
themselves it's there's a certain

4701
03:22:12,920 --> 03:22:15,080
Pathway to arrive at the conclusion I

4702
03:22:15,080 --> 03:22:17,080
think it passes through imposter complex

4703
03:22:17,080 --> 03:22:19,560
imposter syndrome yeah I I could relate

4704
03:22:19,560 --> 03:22:21,359
it to

4705
03:22:21,359 --> 03:22:23,479
that yeah but I think the Imposter

4706
03:22:23,479 --> 03:22:24,880
complex serious one right like I

4707
03:22:24,880 --> 03:22:28,439
genuinely believe that I had I have no

4708
03:22:28,439 --> 03:22:31,040
business sitting here right

4709
03:22:31,040 --> 03:22:33,439
likea town would have gotten lus if I

4710
03:22:33,439 --> 03:22:36,960
had gotten infosis uh assistant

4711
03:22:36,960 --> 03:22:38,439
technical engineer well that is the

4712
03:22:38,439 --> 03:22:40,600
starting job called in which you get

4713
03:22:40,600 --> 03:22:42,199
three lakh salary like if I had gotten

4714
03:22:42,199 --> 03:22:44,399
that our town would have celebrated I

4715
03:22:44,399 --> 03:22:46,800
would have been super happy my mom for

4716
03:22:46,800 --> 03:22:49,000
the longest time thought that I have

4717
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:50,520
gotten into friendship with wrong people

4718
03:22:50,520 --> 03:22:51,920
who have gotten me to this

4719
03:22:51,920 --> 03:22:55,960
entrepreneurship buz so I

4720
03:22:55,960 --> 03:22:59,080
[Music]

4721
03:23:00,520 --> 03:23:03,239
think like there was by mistake I got

4722
03:23:03,239 --> 03:23:04,760
into a classroom and it has happened

4723
03:23:04,760 --> 03:23:05,880
many times in life I'll give you an

4724
03:23:05,880 --> 03:23:07,600
example which is very close story and

4725
03:23:07,600 --> 03:23:09,279
I've never talked about it but very

4726
03:23:09,279 --> 03:23:10,359
close to my

4727
03:23:10,359 --> 03:23:13,120
heart so after 12th grade what changed

4728
03:23:13,120 --> 03:23:15,840

Facebook how does a 12th grader know

4732
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:23,640
about who Peter thel is Rebel Without a

4733

Cause $50,000 $100,000 $1,000 right

4734
03:23:29,760 --> 03:23:33,359
to big deal right now how does the 12th

4735
03:23:33,359 --> 03:23:35,120
grader get to know even about

4736
03:23:35,120 --> 03:23:38,920
Peter so Rebel Without

4737
03:23:40,680 --> 03:23:42,880
a

4738
03:23:42,880 --> 03:23:45,680
ship social network

4739
03:23:45,680 --> 03:23:47,960
mov in that there is this person called

4740
03:23:47,960 --> 03:23:50,399
Peter who gives the first $100,000 check

4741
03:23:50,399 --> 03:23:51,920
so next time I go to a cyber how does

4742
03:23:51,920 --> 03:23:53,080
that work just for people who are

4743
03:23:53,080 --> 03:23:54,319
watching and

4744
03:23:54,319 --> 03:23:57,120
interested not just teal Fellowship but

4745
03:23:57,120 --> 03:23:58,760
anything similar that they'd like to

4746
03:23:58,760 --> 03:24:01,560
apply for how does one find out where

4747
03:24:01,560 --> 03:24:03,319
these scholarships are and apply for

4748
03:24:03,319 --> 03:24:06,199
them look I found it through Serendipity

4749
03:24:06,199 --> 03:24:07,920
but I will give a few examples that I'm

4750
03:24:07,920 --> 03:24:09,680
aware of and some of the things that I'm

4751
03:24:09,680 --> 03:24:11,880
also doing as an outcome so theal

4752
03:24:11,880 --> 03:24:13,279
Fellowship is one which is a program

4753
03:24:13,279 --> 03:24:15,279
started by Peter theel where he gives

4754
03:24:15,279 --> 03:24:18,399
$100,000 to 20 people earlier it used to

4755
03:24:18,399 --> 03:24:21,319
be age limitation under the age of 20

4756
03:24:21,319 --> 03:24:23,520
acceptance rates are lower than IV leaks

4757
03:24:23,520 --> 03:24:25,319
but there's one condition you have to

4758
03:24:25,319 --> 03:24:27,040
stop out of

4759
03:24:27,040 --> 03:24:29,439
college right if you're in college if

4760
03:24:29,439 --> 03:24:31,239
you're in college I was not in college

4761
03:24:31,239 --> 03:24:33,640
so it was easier and the thesis behind

4762
03:24:33,640 --> 03:24:36,199
it the contract's first line says we

4763
03:24:36,199 --> 03:24:38,399
never let University interfere with

4764
03:24:38,399 --> 03:24:40,760
education so education is everywhere

4765
03:24:40,760 --> 03:24:44,960
including the WTF podcast um but you

4766
03:24:44,960 --> 03:24:46,239
don't have to go to university for it

4767
03:24:46,239 --> 03:24:47,479
but University is one of the sources of

4768
03:24:47,479 --> 03:24:49,880
it you can also pursue education there

4769
03:24:49,880 --> 03:24:52,640
so um I was a theal fellow but there are

4770
03:24:52,640 --> 03:24:54,199
other theal fellows like the founder of

4771
03:24:54,199 --> 03:24:55,760
ethereum is a theal fellow which is a

4772
03:24:55,760 --> 03:24:58,000
cryptocurrency founder of figma figma is

4773
03:24:58,000 --> 03:24:59,720
a design tool very popular over the

4774
03:24:59,720 --> 03:25:02,439
years so a bunch of these people who are

4775
03:25:02,439 --> 03:25:04,080
exceptionally successful came to the

4776
03:25:04,080 --> 03:25:05,840
fellowship and everybody has very

4777
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:08,040
similar backgrounds right young people

4778
03:25:08,040 --> 03:25:09,720
they were Rebel Without a Cause wanted

4779
03:25:09,720 --> 03:25:12,080
to make a positive difference but coming

4780
03:25:12,080 --> 03:25:15,120
back the fellowship is one in India

4781
03:25:15,120 --> 03:25:16,439
there's something called the Young India

4782
03:25:16,439 --> 03:25:18,840
found uh young India Fellowship very

4783
03:25:18,840 --> 03:25:20,359
popular Yi Fellowship I think it's

4784
03:25:20,359 --> 03:25:23,439
called it's very popular great uh Sim

4785
03:25:23,439 --> 03:25:26,199
not similar it's very different uh but

4786
03:25:26,199 --> 03:25:27,840
again something that allows young people

4787
03:25:27,840 --> 03:25:30,040
to be able to pursue their aspirations

4788
03:25:30,040 --> 03:25:31,840
but this one I think only invites

4789
03:25:31,840 --> 03:25:34,319
graduates post uh undergrad so basically

4790
03:25:34,319 --> 03:25:35,680
after that if you want to sort of be a

4791
03:25:35,680 --> 03:25:37,520
part of the fellowship I think something

4792
03:25:37,520 --> 03:25:39,199
very different is teach for India I

4793
03:25:39,199 --> 03:25:41,080
think that's another way of making sure

4794
03:25:41,080 --> 03:25:43,120
basically what are the communities where

4795
03:25:43,120 --> 03:25:46,120
you can find people who are slightly

4796
03:25:46,120 --> 03:25:47,800
rebellious who are trying to do

4797
03:25:47,800 --> 03:25:49,800
something new in life who are creative

4798
03:25:49,800 --> 03:25:52,439
who want to do something new it may have

4799
03:25:52,439 --> 03:25:54,880
been art for you it may have been um

4800
03:25:54,880 --> 03:25:59,239
being in um you know uh the company of

4801
03:25:59,239 --> 03:26:02,000
inditex and and their uh you know

4802
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:03,800
ecosystem so I think fundamentally just

4803
03:26:03,800 --> 03:26:05,720
finding people around you that's

4804
03:26:05,720 --> 03:26:07,560
education actually huh that's education

4805
03:26:07,560 --> 03:26:09,160
right you learn from them and it also

4806
03:26:09,160 --> 03:26:11,439
allows you to get it in any University

4807
03:26:11,439 --> 03:26:13,319
you don't get it in any University so I

4808
03:26:13,319 --> 03:26:15,000
think that's the third one I'm doing

4809
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:16,000
something with something that's called

4810
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:17,640
The naropa Fellowship it's started by

4811
03:26:17,640 --> 03:26:21,600
the drpa of ladak again of course uh the

4812
03:26:21,600 --> 03:26:23,760
person who's involved between Ashoka

4813
03:26:23,760 --> 03:26:27,359
University naropa haraa is all the same

4814
03:26:27,359 --> 03:26:31,000
so Ashish and this other person Prat sa

4815
03:26:31,000 --> 03:26:33,600
is the person who's involved and I think

4816
03:26:33,600 --> 03:26:36,000
similar fellowship and what I have done

4817
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:38,040
with them is started a naropa rites

4818
03:26:38,040 --> 03:26:39,640
Fellowship where we basically these are

4819
03:26:39,640 --> 03:26:42,080
mostly hilly terrain kids kids gotten

4820
03:26:42,080 --> 03:26:44,479
out of college want to do something new

4821
03:26:44,479 --> 03:26:46,840
so I give them Equity free debt free

4822
03:26:46,840 --> 03:26:48,840
grants because the theal fellowship

4823
03:26:48,840 --> 03:26:50,960
changed my life so I thought can I help

4824
03:26:50,960 --> 03:26:53,720
make difference same with the zepto kids

4825
03:26:53,720 --> 03:26:55,199
they got a 40 lakh Grand they built

4826
03:26:55,199 --> 03:26:57,560
zepto in the back of that really yeah

4827
03:26:57,560 --> 03:27:00,080
was that the game changer after 12 theal

4828
03:27:00,080 --> 03:27:01,560
theal Fellowship was a game changer I

4829
03:27:01,560 --> 03:27:02,800
think that changed my life were you like

4830
03:27:02,800 --> 03:27:05,439
a great student up until that point like

4831
03:27:05,439 --> 03:27:07,800
first rank types not first rank I think

4832
03:27:07,800 --> 03:27:09,960
third fourth second to Fourth rank in

4833
03:27:09,960 --> 03:27:13,199
until 10th grade same thing yeah uh but

4834
03:27:13,199 --> 03:27:15,920
11th 12th grade not so much no why uh

4835
03:27:15,920 --> 03:27:18,520
because um so I think until 10th grade I

4836
03:27:18,520 --> 03:27:21,040
was in Raa post 10th grade most kids go

4837
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:23,680
outside for Education right uh so my

4838
03:27:23,680 --> 03:27:27,040
Elder three siblings one went to um I

4839
03:27:27,040 --> 03:27:29,760
think other towns in udisa only bigger

4840
03:27:29,760 --> 03:27:33,479
towns um because in our town the only

4841
03:27:33,479 --> 03:27:36,960
way to get that was one college and that

4842
03:27:36,960 --> 03:27:40,319
wasn't like most preferred route but

4843
03:27:40,319 --> 03:27:41,880
parents had some savings because Elder

4844
03:27:41,880 --> 03:27:43,920
three siblings most of them got one of

4845
03:27:43,920 --> 03:27:46,560
their degrees through uh what is called

4846
03:27:46,560 --> 03:27:48,840
scholarship so parents had some savings

4847
03:27:48,840 --> 03:27:53,000
so I said Rebel to I want to go to Kota

4848
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:56,600
Rajasthan Kota is much more expensive to

4849
03:27:56,600 --> 03:27:59,000
send a child to than that of somewhere

4850
03:27:59,000 --> 03:28:01,960
in odisa right because you have to send

4851
03:28:01,960 --> 03:28:04,479
uh three-day trains both sides so you

4852
03:28:04,479 --> 03:28:07,040
are the Kota Factory I'm I'm a part of

4853
03:28:07,040 --> 03:28:10,279
the Kota factory production so during

4854
03:28:10,279 --> 03:28:14,279
those two years I used to sort of um uh

4855
03:28:14,279 --> 03:28:16,000
you know intern in small companies and

4856
03:28:16,000 --> 03:28:16,800
so

4857
03:28:16,800 --> 03:28:19,399
on while of course education education I

4858
03:28:19,399 --> 03:28:21,040
was not the first second ranker but

4859
03:28:21,040 --> 03:28:23,279
still reasonably good ranker so I was

4860
03:28:23,279 --> 03:28:25,920
not like I was terrible uh in terms of

4861
03:28:25,920 --> 03:28:27,239
impact so parents were generally

4862
03:28:27,239 --> 03:28:29,399
comfortable so I was not the kaga top

4863
03:28:29,399 --> 03:28:32,239
kids I was medium so I did all

4864
03:28:32,239 --> 03:28:36,160
right so 12th grade beach around right

4865
03:28:36,160 --> 03:28:37,120
after 12th

4866
03:28:37,120 --> 03:28:39,239
grade that is when I applied for the the

4867
03:28:39,239 --> 03:28:42,399
fellowship and became a theal fellow um

4868
03:28:42,399 --> 03:28:46,720
the first time I got a call so I applied

4869
03:28:46,720 --> 03:28:49,560
uh because I heard about Peter the apply

4870
03:28:49,560 --> 03:28:52,040
this I'm not where is this the you apply

4871
03:28:52,040 --> 03:28:54,359
online online you apply online and it's

4872
03:28:54,359 --> 03:28:56,880
just online class digital application no

4873
03:28:56,880 --> 03:28:58,439
class submit when you make the

4874
03:28:58,439 --> 03:29:00,199
application just a bunch of questions

4875
03:29:00,199 --> 03:29:01,560
bunch of about what business Do you want

4876
03:29:01,560 --> 03:29:04,279
to build what did you say oo I didn't

4877
03:29:04,279 --> 03:29:06,239
call it oo then but I but effectively

4878
03:29:06,239 --> 03:29:08,399
the idea was the oo idea which I

4879
03:29:08,399 --> 03:29:10,479
proposed accommodation with some

4880
03:29:10,479 --> 03:29:13,359
standardization that we can provide um I

4881
03:29:13,359 --> 03:29:16,560
think fundamentally post those questions

4882
03:29:16,560 --> 03:29:18,120
there was no other Asian resident who

4883
03:29:18,120 --> 03:29:19,800
had become a fellow before me so I gave

4884
03:29:19,800 --> 03:29:21,560
myself 0% chance to become a fellow but

4885
03:29:21,560 --> 03:29:24,040
I enjoyed the questions I answered them

4886
03:29:24,040 --> 03:29:26,399
then interview started so there

4887
03:29:26,399 --> 03:29:28,319
telephone interviews so the product head

4888
03:29:28,319 --> 03:29:29,680
of Twitter will get on an interview with

4889
03:29:29,680 --> 03:29:31,880
you for a 12th grader to be on an

4890
03:29:31,880 --> 03:29:33,279
interview with people like those was a

4891
03:29:33,279 --> 03:29:34,520
big deal and I would do it like on a

4892
03:29:34,520 --> 03:29:36,560
feature phone of one of the friends

4893
03:29:36,560 --> 03:29:39,399
basati friends who was staying next to

4894
03:29:39,399 --> 03:29:42,479
me one day I get this call which is you

4895
03:29:42,479 --> 03:29:45,040
among the top 40 candidates selected and

4896
03:29:45,040 --> 03:29:46,800
will'll fly you to the US and you can

4897
03:29:46,800 --> 03:29:48,439
pitch and 20 would get selected post the

4898
03:29:48,439 --> 03:29:51,960
pitch I was like so excited about it the

4899
03:29:51,960 --> 03:29:53,199
reason was not because I thought I'll

4900
03:29:53,199 --> 03:29:54,560
become a theal fellow I still give

4901
03:29:54,560 --> 03:29:57,840
myself 0% chance it was my first flight

4902
03:29:57,840 --> 03:29:59,279
and international flight trip I would

4903
03:29:59,279 --> 03:30:01,080
ever get for free somebody else was

4904
03:30:01,080 --> 03:30:04,000
paying for it

4905
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:08,600
so life is made right so but again

4906
03:30:08,600 --> 03:30:11,560
coming back to how parents are helpful

4907
03:30:11,560 --> 03:30:14,560
I got like a few days in that period mom

4908
03:30:14,560 --> 03:30:17,399
got the passport made I didn't have a

4909
03:30:17,399 --> 03:30:19,840
passport for US Visa I didn't know was

4910
03:30:19,840 --> 03:30:22,520
so hard and and yeah this is an example

4911
03:30:22,520 --> 03:30:24,760
of why I believe that genuinely I'm

4912
03:30:24,760 --> 03:30:29,560
lucky so I was told

4913
03:30:29,560 --> 03:30:31,600
biometric they send a letter you give

4914
03:30:31,600 --> 03:30:33,160
the letter you get the visa and you have

4915
03:30:33,160 --> 03:30:34,880
to go to Delhi or Bombay or no I was in

4916
03:30:34,880 --> 03:30:36,640
Delhi only so it was even easier so I

4917
03:30:36,640 --> 03:30:38,600
got when biometric done next day was the

4918
03:30:38,600 --> 03:30:40,720
interview now interview I thought that

4919
03:30:40,720 --> 03:30:42,239
letter

4920
03:30:42,239 --> 03:30:44,239
so I basically was wearing shorts had my

4921
03:30:44,239 --> 03:30:47,199
hair all over and I reached the US

4922
03:30:47,199 --> 03:30:49,600
Embassy and I see people are wearing

4923
03:30:49,600 --> 03:30:52,399
jackets ties have big books interviewing

4924
03:30:52,399 --> 03:30:54,399
each other so I thought maybe they have

4925
03:30:54,399 --> 03:30:55,800
come here for some job interview some

4926
03:30:55,800 --> 03:30:58,520
different work my work is

4927
03:30:58,520 --> 03:31:01,120
different that's the level of coming to

4928
03:31:01,120 --> 03:31:03,880
self-confidence very self-confident I

4929
03:31:03,880 --> 03:31:07,080
reached the interview lady and right

4930
03:31:07,080 --> 03:31:11,680
like as as I get closer line us

4931
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:14,600
so I thought different but reaching the

4932
03:31:14,600 --> 03:31:16,319
counter we were all in the same counter

4933
03:31:16,319 --> 03:31:17,680
path so I'm starting to feel that

4934
03:31:17,680 --> 03:31:19,000
something different but I was still

4935
03:31:19,000 --> 03:31:20,520
convincing myself that they start making

4936
03:31:20,520 --> 03:31:23,080
your hair Peter theel has given me a

4937
03:31:23,080 --> 03:31:25,199
letter in my mind I thought that you

4938
03:31:25,199 --> 03:31:27,359
know he must like the Visa will be given

4939
03:31:27,359 --> 03:31:29,359
immediately so the lady asked what's

4940
03:31:29,359 --> 03:31:31,120
your purpose of visit to the

4941
03:31:31,120 --> 03:31:34,160
US so I say I want to drop out by

4942
03:31:34,160 --> 03:31:36,760
becoming a theal fellow she listens

4943
03:31:36,760 --> 03:31:39,040
Dropout and in her mind goes this guy is

4944
03:31:39,040 --> 03:31:42,279
going to go to the gas station

4945
03:31:42,279 --> 03:31:45,560
next that's his plan and weirdly he's

4946
03:31:45,560 --> 03:31:48,279
being honest about it

4947
03:31:48,279 --> 03:31:51,760
also I only learned this later because

4948
03:31:51,760 --> 03:31:52,960
then she

4949
03:31:52,960 --> 03:31:57,720
says uh do you have uh like if that's a

4950
03:31:57,720 --> 03:31:59,640
purpose of visit is there an education

4951
03:31:59,640 --> 03:32:02,560
also you want to pursue I say yes theal

4952
03:32:02,560 --> 03:32:04,319
Fellowship can be considered as

4953
03:32:04,319 --> 03:32:06,359
education so she said do you have any

4954
03:32:06,359 --> 03:32:08,560
documentation for it I said there's this

4955
03:32:08,560 --> 03:32:11,479
letter so she said

4956
03:32:11,479 --> 03:32:13,600
uh unfortunately it doesn't seem like we

4957
03:32:13,600 --> 03:32:15,399
can give you the Visa but we can't also

4958
03:32:15,399 --> 03:32:17,080
return you the passport so typically if

4959
03:32:17,080 --> 03:32:18,120
they reject the Visa they give you back

4960
03:32:18,120 --> 03:32:20,319
the passport so I said you can't reject

4961
03:32:20,319 --> 03:32:23,160
the Visa first off and second my flight

4962
03:32:23,160 --> 03:32:25,199
is day after tomorrow so you return the

4963
03:32:25,199 --> 03:32:27,359
passport to me anyway she says

4964
03:32:27,359 --> 03:32:29,600
unfortunately that's not how it

4965
03:32:29,600 --> 03:32:33,760
works and shuts down the window I came

4966
03:32:33,760 --> 03:32:35,840
back home I cried like crazy because I

4967
03:32:35,840 --> 03:32:38,120
thought

4968
03:32:39,840 --> 03:32:42,840
that

4969
03:32:43,399 --> 03:32:44,920
and before that I had cold emailed so

4970
03:32:44,920 --> 03:32:46,479
many people I had cold emailed like 100

4971
03:32:46,479 --> 03:32:48,239
people saying that I want to come see

4972
03:32:48,239 --> 03:32:50,520
like your office or so on like I cold

4973
03:32:50,520 --> 03:32:53,399
emailed God bless him ton sh of Zap and

4974
03:32:53,399 --> 03:32:55,680
so on

4975
03:32:55,920 --> 03:32:58,960
say so anyway long story short um you

4976
03:32:58,960 --> 03:33:00,880
know I wrote to the the fellowship as

4977
03:33:00,880 --> 03:33:02,359
well saying that they didn't give me the

4978
03:33:02,359 --> 03:33:03,880
Visa can you write a letter to them so

4979
03:33:03,880 --> 03:33:06,040
that there's some credibility they wrote

4980
03:33:06,040 --> 03:33:07,800
a letter and the embassy was nice to

4981
03:33:07,800 --> 03:33:09,359
later give me the

4982
03:33:09,359 --> 03:33:11,840
Visa I got to the flight next day even

4983
03:33:11,840 --> 03:33:13,399
the flight was a weird thing I had a

4984
03:33:13,399 --> 03:33:15,399
lansa flight the lansa flight got

4985
03:33:15,399 --> 03:33:18,120
cancelled the fellowship was nice to

4986
03:33:18,120 --> 03:33:20,560
book a British Airway right after so I

4987
03:33:20,560 --> 03:33:22,319
think just fundamentally for me I feel

4988
03:33:22,319 --> 03:33:24,800
like this long story is just to say

4989
03:33:24,800 --> 03:33:27,040
that anything could have gone wrong in

4990
03:33:27,040 --> 03:33:29,120
this the Visa could not have come the

4991
03:33:29,120 --> 03:33:31,640
flight would not have uh uh you know

4992
03:33:31,640 --> 03:33:33,760
happened something could have gone wrong

4993
03:33:33,760 --> 03:33:36,880
so in life we forget when we reached to

4994
03:33:36,880 --> 03:33:39,760
this point there were probably 200

4995
03:33:39,760 --> 03:33:41,399
things that had to go right

4996
03:33:41,399 --> 03:33:44,000
and if that one thing did not go right

4997
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:45,239
You' probably be in a very different

4998
03:33:45,239 --> 03:33:48,080
place you say Serendipity a little bit

4999
03:33:48,080 --> 03:33:51,640
more than usual yes true true belief in

5000
03:33:51,640 --> 03:33:53,279
that I have true belief I have true

5001
03:33:53,279 --> 03:33:55,279
belief in

5002
03:33:55,279 --> 03:33:59,600
um if you work hard um uh opportunities

5003
03:33:59,600 --> 03:34:02,840
will come your way um which otherwise

5004
03:34:02,840 --> 03:34:05,279
would not have what have been the most

5005
03:34:05,279 --> 03:34:07,199
serendipitious

5006
03:34:07,199 --> 03:34:09,239
events that you can remember if you were

5007
03:34:09,239 --> 03:34:12,680
to name just two just two

5008
03:34:12,840 --> 03:34:15,800
the US Embassy I'm guessing is one yes

5009
03:34:15,800 --> 03:34:17,479
so that's one I'll try the second one I

5010
03:34:17,479 --> 03:34:19,359
think the second one is actually I'll

5011
03:34:19,359 --> 03:34:23,880
say two uh two more one is um possibly

5012
03:34:23,880 --> 03:34:25,680
how I met Anuj most people don't know

5013
03:34:25,680 --> 03:34:28,359
Anuj Anuj and I started oo together so

5014
03:34:28,359 --> 03:34:30,760
before oo I was running oravel for 6

5015
03:34:30,760 --> 03:34:32,439
months and then I flipped to oo he

5016
03:34:32,439 --> 03:34:35,000
joined me in oravel and then we together

5017
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:37,760
pivoted to make it too he still with you

5018
03:34:37,760 --> 03:34:42,359
he's still with me so um

5019
03:34:42,359 --> 03:34:43,920
at that when I was running arrival it

5020
03:34:43,920 --> 03:34:45,680
was me and one intern both of us to run

5021
03:34:45,680 --> 03:34:47,720
the company sahil was the intern sahil

5022
03:34:47,720 --> 03:34:49,840
of course had told me when he was

5023
03:34:49,840 --> 03:34:52,080
interviewing that after 2 to 3 years

5024
03:34:52,080 --> 03:34:53,399
once he makes enough money he will set

5025
03:34:53,399 --> 03:34:55,479
up a restaurant and he'll leave me so

5026
03:34:55,479 --> 03:34:57,040
two to the fact 3 years later he left

5027
03:34:57,040 --> 03:34:59,040
and now runs fantastic couple of

5028
03:34:59,040 --> 03:35:04,239
restaurants in Bombay um so Anu calls he

5029
03:35:04,239 --> 03:35:05,760
wherever he figures about arrival he

5030
03:35:05,760 --> 03:35:07,160
calls the call

5031
03:35:07,160 --> 03:35:10,319
center sahil picks up he thinks it's a

5032
03:35:10,319 --> 03:35:11,319
big

5033
03:35:11,319 --> 03:35:12,640
says can I can you connect me to the

5034
03:35:12,640 --> 03:35:14,080
Chairman's

5035
03:35:14,080 --> 03:35:17,080
office

5036
03:35:20,479 --> 03:35:23,319
says he hands over the every all of us

5037
03:35:23,319 --> 03:35:25,120
have gone through the stories right we

5038
03:35:25,120 --> 03:35:27,720
have I get the phone and I keep and I'm

5039
03:35:27,720 --> 03:35:30,279
telling

5040
03:35:34,680 --> 03:35:37,640
on but

5041
03:35:37,640 --> 03:35:41,359
any and an speaks and you know he's is

5042
03:35:41,359 --> 03:35:42,640
opposite of me right like he went to

5043
03:35:42,640 --> 03:35:45,040
itbu built his business during school

5044
03:35:45,040 --> 03:35:47,720
sold it uh went to uiu for some

5045
03:35:47,720 --> 03:35:49,760
internship but then had come and joined

5046
03:35:49,760 --> 03:35:51,239
a consulting company and was hitting it

5047
03:35:51,239 --> 03:35:54,000
so he wanted to leave it and build

5048
03:35:54,000 --> 03:35:56,359
something so we speak for 50 minutes and

5049
03:35:56,359 --> 03:35:58,479
he said I have explored Airbnb in the US

5050
03:35:58,479 --> 03:36:01,720
this is my view so I I made as much

5051
03:36:01,720 --> 03:36:03,399
copious notes as I could and at the end

5052
03:36:03,399 --> 03:36:05,120
I said that those it's been great

5053
03:36:05,120 --> 03:36:07,640
talking to you but I can't afford you

5054
03:36:07,640 --> 03:36:09,359
but I learned so much the day I can

5055
03:36:09,359 --> 03:36:11,960
afford you we'll chat again

5056
03:36:11,960 --> 03:36:13,720
then he says but I'm I'm happy to meet

5057
03:36:13,720 --> 03:36:16,920
you I said if you want to meet after

5058
03:36:16,920 --> 03:36:18,640
hearing what you have heard be my guest

5059
03:36:18,640 --> 03:36:22,560
please come so he came again we spent an

5060
03:36:22,560 --> 03:36:25,319
hour I learned more at the end I again

5061
03:36:25,319 --> 03:36:29,439
said but can't uh afford you so he said

5062
03:36:29,439 --> 03:36:31,239
there is this thing called ESOP I don't

5063
03:36:31,239 --> 03:36:34,439
need salary I'm going to offer no salary

5064
03:36:34,439 --> 03:36:36,199
I'll in fact put some money if

5065
03:36:36,199 --> 03:36:39,160
required but you give me esops so I said

5066
03:36:39,160 --> 03:36:40,640
this is a great thing without salary you

5067
03:36:40,640 --> 03:36:44,720
will work so I said perfect done esops

5068
03:36:44,720 --> 03:36:46,920
so he said I want whatever I think I

5069
03:36:46,920 --> 03:36:49,560
don't remember 3 and a half or 4% es I

5070
03:36:49,560 --> 03:36:51,760
said

5071
03:36:53,600 --> 03:36:55,560
perfect so that was my concept of

5072
03:36:55,560 --> 03:36:57,600
learning of ESOP in the first time like

5073
03:36:57,600 --> 03:36:59,720
the

5074
03:36:59,960 --> 03:37:02,960
appreciation

5075
03:37:03,359 --> 03:37:05,800
well like depreciation of yours correct

5076
03:37:05,800 --> 03:37:07,960
correct so I thought this is fantastic

5077
03:37:07,960 --> 03:37:09,359
later I recognized that you know this is

5078
03:37:09,359 --> 03:37:11,399
probably one of the best dishs teate but

5079
03:37:11,399 --> 03:37:13,319
for me it was a because for the first

5080
03:37:13,319 --> 03:37:15,359
time I saw what working with somebody

5081
03:37:15,359 --> 03:37:17,680
who was who understood process who

5082
03:37:17,680 --> 03:37:19,560
understood systems who could document

5083
03:37:19,560 --> 03:37:21,000
what did that look like was before that

5084
03:37:21,000 --> 03:37:22,680
I only worked with interns I didn't have

5085
03:37:22,680 --> 03:37:24,560
appreciation of anybody else outside of

5086
03:37:24,560 --> 03:37:26,880
that second is beel right like I was in

5087
03:37:26,880 --> 03:37:28,760
the during the the fellowship in the

5088
03:37:28,760 --> 03:37:31,760
US um he beel was also in the US because

5089
03:37:31,760 --> 03:37:34,439
light speed has a uh like the main

5090
03:37:34,439 --> 03:37:38,720
office in the US I met him uh uh and at

5091
03:37:38,720 --> 03:37:40,080
the end of it we said that it's been

5092
03:37:40,080 --> 03:37:42,199
great meeting each other we'll reconnect

5093
03:37:42,199 --> 03:37:43,359
sometime

5094
03:37:43,359 --> 03:37:45,920
H they kept doing the work in India we

5095
03:37:45,920 --> 03:37:47,640
had one oo Hotel then we then opened

5096
03:37:47,640 --> 03:37:49,439
another so they visited those hotels

5097
03:37:49,439 --> 03:37:50,760
they visited other hotels they met the

5098
03:37:50,760 --> 03:37:52,680
property owners then one day called us

5099
03:37:52,680 --> 03:37:54,000
saying that we want to try and do

5100
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:57,120
something with you um I think beel also

5101
03:37:57,120 --> 03:37:58,600
I think other than the fellowship Peter

5102
03:37:58,600 --> 03:38:01,800
the beel changed my life I think he was

5103
03:38:01,800 --> 03:38:03,760
uh I think the other person who I tried

5104
03:38:03,760 --> 03:38:06,199
to emulate a lot is I think beel I think

5105
03:38:06,199 --> 03:38:09,680
he has a sense of calm he like this uh I

5106
03:38:09,680 --> 03:38:13,840
I I I think so uh and and I think uh he

5107
03:38:13,840 --> 03:38:15,920
he's uh genuinely like feedbacks for

5108
03:38:15,920 --> 03:38:18,040
example communication I'll give you an

5109
03:38:18,040 --> 03:38:19,680
interesting example of an uncomfortable

5110
03:38:19,680 --> 03:38:22,399
conversation I brought it up right so we

5111
03:38:22,399 --> 03:38:24,960
had a call center like most companies

5112
03:38:24,960 --> 03:38:27,800
and I used to be the call center person

5113
03:38:27,800 --> 03:38:30,000
who would pick up calls customer call I

5114
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:32,439
make the booking and I used to love it

5115
03:38:32,439 --> 03:38:34,160
because you speak to customer directly

5116
03:38:34,160 --> 03:38:36,920
such an amazing job right so even after

5117
03:38:36,920 --> 03:38:40,000
they invested I kept doing that job so

5118
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:42,279
he would invite me every month for lunch

5119
03:38:42,279 --> 03:38:44,000
I'd go to that lunch so he feed me very

5120
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:47,279
well at the end he says sures I hear

5121
03:38:47,279 --> 03:38:50,840
your loving your call center job I say

5122
03:38:50,840 --> 03:38:52,640
it's great I listen to customers and so

5123
03:38:52,640 --> 03:38:55,720
on so he says in his like at the end

5124
03:38:55,720 --> 03:38:57,840
that so that's great we found the call

5125
03:38:57,840 --> 03:39:00,319
center head of Oo we should now start

5126
03:39:00,319 --> 03:39:03,279
finding the CEO should we start a

5127
03:39:03,279 --> 03:39:06,319
process I said look I get it I get it

5128
03:39:06,319 --> 03:39:08,560
that what I'm doing is not my job and we

5129
03:39:08,560 --> 03:39:10,760
will recruit someone but I think ability

5130
03:39:10,760 --> 03:39:14,640
to say something in such a nice kind way

5131
03:39:14,640 --> 03:39:17,080
that at that room you feel like you know

5132
03:39:17,080 --> 03:39:18,680
it's a objective feedback but when you

5133
03:39:18,680 --> 03:39:20,600
walk out you feel that that was a pretty

5134
03:39:20,600 --> 03:39:23,279
intense feedback uh is something I've

5135
03:39:23,279 --> 03:39:25,840
learned from him I guess and Beyond 12th

5136
03:39:25,840 --> 03:39:28,560
what happened the's Fellowship yeah

5137
03:39:28,560 --> 03:39:31,199
$1,000 came back to India so I was there

5138
03:39:31,199 --> 03:39:33,640
in the US for four five months uh lived

5139
03:39:33,640 --> 03:39:36,120
in a hacker house with other the fellows

5140
03:39:36,120 --> 03:39:40,199
um but came back to India in 2013 mid m

5141
03:39:40,199 --> 03:39:45,279
M uh we uh that was we was me Anuj and

5142
03:39:45,279 --> 03:39:47,680
couple of interns at that point of time

5143
03:39:47,680 --> 03:39:49,800
and then sort of uh at the similar time

5144
03:39:49,800 --> 03:39:51,640
light speed chose to invest a few months

5145
03:39:51,640 --> 03:39:55,359
later light speed invested I think 3.5

5146
03:39:55,359 --> 03:39:59,279
crores at a 8 CR valuation U Back Then

5147
03:39:59,279 --> 03:40:02,040
it's a huge deal for us I think uh I had

5148
03:40:02,040 --> 03:40:04,359
never seen a COR together in a bank

5149
03:40:04,359 --> 03:40:07,560
account in my life um uh before that so

5150
03:40:07,560 --> 03:40:09,279
it put just a sense of accountability

5151
03:40:09,279 --> 03:40:11,960
that now you have to like make good that

5152
03:40:11,960 --> 03:40:13,080
there's somebody else who's willing to

5153
03:40:13,080 --> 03:40:16,120
commit so much Capital behind you and I

5154
03:40:16,120 --> 03:40:19,680
think uh this since 2013 um end roughly

5155
03:40:19,680 --> 03:40:22,120
or 2014 early is when we really started

5156
03:40:22,120 --> 03:40:26,680
growing the business and um uh you know

5157
03:40:26,680 --> 03:40:28,319
we've we've continued in that path we've

5158
03:40:28,319 --> 03:40:30,479
gone through our highs and lows as you

5159
03:40:30,479 --> 03:40:32,640
uh may have observed you read uh that

5160
03:40:32,640 --> 03:40:35,399
there were orbitar there was K like I

5161
03:40:35,399 --> 03:40:38,160
feel what helped you deal with the lows

5162
03:40:38,160 --> 03:40:40,920
what personality trade

5163
03:40:40,920 --> 03:40:43,279
look I think

5164
03:40:43,279 --> 03:40:46,640
um two things right

5165
03:40:46,640 --> 03:40:48,160
um

5166
03:40:48,160 --> 03:40:51,760
fundamentally one we got more love than

5167
03:40:51,760 --> 03:40:53,920
we deserved so if you remember that we

5168
03:40:53,920 --> 03:40:56,239
were getting too much appreciation

5169
03:40:56,239 --> 03:40:59,279
sometimes but sometimes we also got

5170
03:40:59,279 --> 03:41:01,600
beaten down a lot more I think the trait

5171
03:41:01,600 --> 03:41:03,239
off for a 20year

5172
03:41:03,239 --> 03:41:07,160
old um for them to have that one day at

5173
03:41:07,160 --> 03:41:09,359
College when they become the Superstar

5174
03:41:09,359 --> 03:41:11,800
and next week they are considered like

5175
03:41:11,800 --> 03:41:12,600
an

5176
03:41:12,600 --> 03:41:17,199
outcast I think

5177
03:41:17,439 --> 03:41:22,279
um I think the trait is um always being

5178
03:41:22,279 --> 03:41:25,159
an optimist about the future and knowing

5179
03:41:25,159 --> 03:41:27,840
that things will change uh either

5180
03:41:27,840 --> 03:41:30,439
positively or negatively I think I would

5181
03:41:30,439 --> 03:41:33,239
say optimism and coming to terms with

5182
03:41:33,239 --> 03:41:35,040
the cyclical nature of yes and and

5183
03:41:35,040 --> 03:41:37,720
coming to awareness of cyclicality yeah

5184
03:41:37,720 --> 03:41:40,600
I would say that one needs to just be

5185
03:41:40,600 --> 03:41:44,920
um aware and comfortable that uh if an

5186
03:41:44,920 --> 03:41:47,479
amitab bachan was in Crazy debt and

5187
03:41:47,479 --> 03:41:49,960
everybody wrote him off he can come back

5188
03:41:49,960 --> 03:41:52,399
to become one of the wealthiest stars in

5189
03:41:52,399 --> 03:41:54,680
less than 20 years most bankable stars

5190
03:41:54,680 --> 03:41:56,399
one of the most bankable stars and that

5191
03:41:56,399 --> 03:41:58,520
doesn't happen as an exception that's

5192
03:41:58,520 --> 03:42:01,720
pretty much the norm for anybody who can

5193
03:42:01,720 --> 03:42:03,920
stick their neck out and continue so I

5194
03:42:03,920 --> 03:42:06,520
think if you are a 20-year-old and I

5195
03:42:06,520 --> 03:42:08,199
have gone through this many

5196
03:42:08,199 --> 03:42:11,000
times where everybody around you thought

5197
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:14,199
that you are a done deal the seven days

5198
03:42:14,199 --> 03:42:17,359
when I was kept out of school um and I

5199
03:42:17,359 --> 03:42:19,000
was a prefect at that point of time so

5200
03:42:19,000 --> 03:42:22,159
being a prefect and being told that out

5201
03:42:22,159 --> 03:42:24,600
you're uh suspended from school for some

5202
03:42:24,600 --> 03:42:28,920
time so that that is my unique um

5203
03:42:28,920 --> 03:42:30,640
contrarian perspective that I've always

5204
03:42:30,640 --> 03:42:32,399
had that I would be a prefect but I'd

5205
03:42:32,399 --> 03:42:34,680
also be slightly rebellious uh which is

5206
03:42:34,680 --> 03:42:36,279
sort of what you also mentioned earlier

5207
03:42:36,279 --> 03:42:38,319
in the perspective of saying that you

5208
03:42:38,319 --> 03:42:41,000
have this contrarian side to yourself so

5209
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:43,520
I think in those times I think it's very

5210
03:42:43,520 --> 03:42:45,760
easy to give up and I was told that I'll

5211
03:42:45,760 --> 03:42:47,359
not give you the certificate of the

5212
03:42:47,359 --> 03:42:50,600
prefect because of this a tough time is

5213
03:42:50,600 --> 03:42:52,479
like a messy room you have to tidy it up

5214
03:42:52,479 --> 03:42:54,199
again because you want to live back in

5215
03:42:54,199 --> 03:42:56,319
this space so you have to be absolutely

5216
03:42:56,319 --> 03:42:57,760
comfortable that you know there will be

5217
03:42:57,760 --> 03:42:59,319
good days in the future and there will

5218
03:42:59,319 --> 03:43:00,920
be bad days and there will be good days

5219
03:43:00,920 --> 03:43:02,680
and if you're having great days you

5220
03:43:02,680 --> 03:43:04,800
should know that the bad days are coming

5221
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:06,439
and whatever you can do to prepare for

5222
03:43:06,439 --> 03:43:08,760
it is better to do it are you guys also

5223
03:43:08,760 --> 03:43:10,920
optimistic guzzle are you

5224
03:43:10,920 --> 03:43:13,960
unreasonably optimistic not unreasonably

5225
03:43:13,960 --> 03:43:17,159
optimistic I am optimistic because what

5226
03:43:17,159 --> 03:43:18,920
I believe in it

5227
03:43:18,920 --> 03:43:21,760
is if it's good it won't last if it's

5228
03:43:21,760 --> 03:43:26,000
bad it won't last similar yeah you I'm

5229
03:43:26,000 --> 03:43:27,800
very optimistic actually it's also your

5230
03:43:27,800 --> 03:43:30,359
life's own behavior which gives you this

5231
03:43:30,359 --> 03:43:33,120
this builtup Factor on this I me you

5232
03:43:33,120 --> 03:43:34,880
take a loan and you think you will pay

5233
03:43:34,880 --> 03:43:36,640
back or not and instead of 15 years you

5234
03:43:36,640 --> 03:43:39,920
pay back in four years it's all every

5235
03:43:39,920 --> 03:43:41,520
expression of your journey and

5236
03:43:41,520 --> 03:43:43,920
everything that you've achieved and and

5237
03:43:43,920 --> 03:43:46,080
gone through gets you more and more

5238
03:43:46,080 --> 03:43:48,359
clear sight for the next uh episode that

5239
03:43:48,359 --> 03:43:50,680
you want to attack but I think that's a

5240
03:43:50,680 --> 03:43:52,640
fundamental difference I think all

5241
03:43:52,640 --> 03:43:55,040
entrepreneurs are optimistic and risk

5242
03:43:55,040 --> 03:43:57,920
risk taking and risk taking but I feel

5243
03:43:57,920 --> 03:44:01,359
that the persevering Optimist types are

5244
03:44:01,359 --> 03:44:03,439
the ones who create long-term

5245
03:44:03,439 --> 03:44:06,120
success I think the most people I have

5246
03:44:06,120 --> 03:44:07,399
found around

5247
03:44:07,399 --> 03:44:10,040
myself um like I feel and to your Point

5248
03:44:10,040 --> 03:44:12,199
N I also believe that not believe I I

5249
03:44:12,199 --> 03:44:16,080
know that I'm not the uh U you know uh

5250
03:44:16,080 --> 03:44:18,319
best engineer best salesperson best

5251
03:44:18,319 --> 03:44:21,359
Finance person any of those things right

5252
03:44:21,359 --> 03:44:22,840
but I feel in our industry all the

5253
03:44:22,840 --> 03:44:25,560
competitors we had whenever the tough

5254
03:44:25,560 --> 03:44:27,880
times came they gave

5255
03:44:27,880 --> 03:44:30,760
up the only thing different about us

5256
03:44:30,760 --> 03:44:32,279
funnily this is the first thing I wrote

5257
03:44:32,279 --> 03:44:35,040
about you when she was speaking

5258
03:44:35,040 --> 03:44:37,560
Relentless have you ever read any Makia

5259
03:44:37,560 --> 03:44:41,239
Val no the Eur European chanaka in a in

5260
03:44:41,239 --> 03:44:43,920
a way no no I've heard about them of

5261
03:44:43,920 --> 03:44:46,319
course you seem to embody a lot of what

5262
03:44:46,319 --> 03:44:48,560
he says you know if you all have watched

5263
03:44:48,560 --> 03:44:51,399
the movie 12 fail no not yet but I've

5264
03:44:51,399 --> 03:44:52,680
heard some incredible you should

5265
03:44:52,680 --> 03:44:55,120
absolutely watch it it is amazing so if

5266
03:44:55,120 --> 03:44:56,840
you watch that movie you will hear that

5267
03:44:56,840 --> 03:44:59,640
you will see that that kid comes from

5268
03:44:59,640 --> 03:45:01,960
chumble and he had that complex saying

5269
03:45:01,960 --> 03:45:04,040
that nobody else from chumble becomes an

5270
03:45:04,040 --> 03:45:07,479
IPS officer without cheating with

5271
03:45:07,479 --> 03:45:12,239
cheating cheating School IP

5272
03:45:19,560 --> 03:45:23,159
off but as Leaders I believe personally

5273
03:45:23,159 --> 03:45:27,439
that big heart trumps big brains have

5274
03:45:27,439 --> 03:45:30,479
you ever read towm anything on it again

5275
03:45:30,479 --> 03:45:33,000
everything you're

5276
03:45:34,040 --> 03:45:36,439
seeing European

5277
03:45:36,439 --> 03:45:39,479
Soul okay how did you deal with your

5278
03:45:39,479 --> 03:45:42,040
father passing away it was look I think

5279
03:45:42,040 --> 03:45:43,960
it was I I think I messaged you that day

5280
03:45:43,960 --> 03:45:46,319
but I read in the news and it you it

5281
03:45:46,319 --> 03:45:50,479
sounded like a life changing I think uh

5282
03:45:50,479 --> 03:45:51,640
I

5283
03:45:51,640 --> 03:45:53,880
think

5284
03:45:53,880 --> 03:45:56,399
um look I think I I don't think I have

5285
03:45:56,399 --> 03:45:58,800
fully processed it even today so I'm

5286
03:45:58,800 --> 03:46:00,760
still sort of there's a Spanish book it

5287
03:46:00,760 --> 03:46:03,159
takes three years to recover for a son

5288
03:46:03,159 --> 03:46:05,279
so I think nothing prepares you for a

5289
03:46:05,279 --> 03:46:08,920
loss of um somebody as close as that

5290
03:46:08,920 --> 03:46:10,239
okay so

5291
03:46:10,239 --> 03:46:13,279
you started uh with the teal Fellowship

5292
03:46:13,279 --> 03:46:16,920
money with your friend Anuj

5293
03:46:16,920 --> 03:46:19,920
oravel converted to oo when did the

5294
03:46:19,920 --> 03:46:23,359
scaling happen first year was very small

5295
03:46:23,359 --> 03:46:26,239
like I think 2014 We Grew From two

5296
03:46:26,239 --> 03:46:28,760
hotels to maybe 10 15 hotels still a lot

5297
03:46:28,760 --> 03:46:31,640
but not like massive I think the real

5298
03:46:31,640 --> 03:46:35,040
growth happened from 2014 all the way to

5299
03:46:35,040 --> 03:46:38,080
2017 which is where we went from a few

5300
03:46:38,080 --> 03:46:40,560
hotels in one City to becoming one of

5301
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:42,800
the most prominent Hotel brands in India

5302
03:46:42,800 --> 03:46:45,560
in the economy and uh economy plus kind

5303
03:46:45,560 --> 03:46:49,600
of segment um

5304
03:46:49,600 --> 03:46:51,960
2019 is when the scaling then happened

5305
03:46:51,960 --> 03:46:53,880
globally we went from being an India

5306
03:46:53,880 --> 03:46:55,760
brand to becoming a globally prominent

5307
03:46:55,760 --> 03:46:57,960
brand so for example just in Europe we

5308
03:46:57,960 --> 03:47:01,000
manage 150,000 Holiday Homes so we have

5309
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:02,600
a fairly large business in Denmark

5310
03:47:02,600 --> 03:47:04,840
Netherlands Germany and and few of these

5311
03:47:04,840 --> 03:47:06,680
geographies so I can relate with getting

5312
03:47:06,680 --> 03:47:09,720
to the cities out of the flight to your

5313
03:47:09,720 --> 03:47:11,560
Hotel do your job and come back so you

5314
03:47:11,560 --> 03:47:12,880
don't have me and GLE would switch

5315
03:47:12,880 --> 03:47:14,880
places with you guys any day they're

5316
03:47:14,880 --> 03:47:16,880
talking Milan

5317
03:47:16,880 --> 03:47:19,319
Madrid now I can get to do that for my

5318
03:47:19,319 --> 03:47:21,319
work my back in the time I would have

5319
03:47:21,319 --> 03:47:24,000
like loved to switch I'm here

5320
03:47:24,000 --> 03:47:26,319
only in terms of discipline there's one

5321
03:47:26,319 --> 03:47:28,040
discipline that I maintain is a holiday

5322
03:47:28,040 --> 03:47:30,279
every month every month every month

5323
03:47:30,279 --> 03:47:31,640
every month

5324
03:47:31,640 --> 03:47:34,159
amazing that one I can last 6 seven

5325
03:47:34,159 --> 03:47:37,040
years how long is the holiday weekend no

5326
03:47:37,040 --> 03:47:40,720
3 days 2 days 5 days whatever comes

5327
03:47:40,720 --> 03:47:43,479
every month every month that's amazing

5328
03:47:43,479 --> 03:47:46,640
like you go out somewhere of the

5329
03:47:46,640 --> 03:47:50,120
city go to JW golfshire and stay in the

5330
03:47:50,120 --> 03:47:52,840
hotel yeah it's a nice

5331
03:47:52,840 --> 03:47:56,080
idea you were describing post getting

5332
03:47:56,080 --> 03:47:58,439
funded post getting yeah so I think 2019

5333
03:47:58,439 --> 03:48:00,000
was a big Global

5334
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:01,960
growth how much money did you guys end

5335
03:48:01,960 --> 03:48:04,199
up raising a lot right yeah we raised uh

5336
03:48:04,199 --> 03:48:05,960
close to a billion and a half dollars

5337
03:48:05,960 --> 03:48:10,159
overall overall little over that M right

5338
03:48:10,159 --> 03:48:13,199
so already I think in 2019 when we grew

5339
03:48:13,199 --> 03:48:15,960
This Global expansion and we also made

5340
03:48:15,960 --> 03:48:19,000
an couple of acquisition I think we were

5341
03:48:19,000 --> 03:48:21,520
starting to see Pains of growth Pains of

5342
03:48:21,520 --> 03:48:23,239
growth meaning how many hotels did you

5343
03:48:23,239 --> 03:48:25,359
have by then India you said

5344
03:48:25,359 --> 03:48:27,479
internationally you mentioned but India

5345
03:48:27,479 --> 03:48:31,040
similar as we have today I think GL

5346
03:48:31,040 --> 03:48:34,000
total already came down now we are

5347
03:48:34,000 --> 03:48:37,640
bouncing back so uh we're fairly sizable

5348
03:48:37,640 --> 03:48:40,279
business uh and if I add China it was

5349
03:48:40,279 --> 03:48:45,040
more at that point of time right so then

5350
03:48:45,040 --> 03:48:48,000
uh so what did Growing Pains mean

5351
03:48:48,000 --> 03:48:49,319
Growing Pains mean that natural

5352
03:48:49,319 --> 03:48:53,159
economics were bad right um and that was

5353
03:48:53,159 --> 03:48:55,760
bad in a very unique way 90% of our

5354
03:48:55,760 --> 03:48:57,960
hotels were Revenue share hotels 10%

5355
03:48:57,960 --> 03:49:00,560
were minimum guarantee those 10% hotels

5356
03:49:00,560 --> 03:49:02,840
drove most of the losses and 90% of them

5357
03:49:02,840 --> 03:49:05,439
were highly margin acreative

5358
03:49:05,439 --> 03:49:08,720
always um I think the management

5359
03:49:08,720 --> 03:49:11,319
bandwidth to a business of that

5360
03:49:11,319 --> 03:49:15,239
spread um and you never in reflection I

5361
03:49:15,239 --> 03:49:16,640
can say that we grew more than we should

5362
03:49:16,640 --> 03:49:17,760
have but at that point of time it's hard

5363
03:49:17,760 --> 03:49:19,640
to know when you GRE too much because

5364
03:49:19,640 --> 03:49:21,720
there's no Playbook like opening 30

5365
03:49:21,720 --> 03:49:23,359
stores is good 10 stores good 20 stores

5366
03:49:23,359 --> 03:49:25,239
is good there's no arithmetic to it and

5367
03:49:25,239 --> 03:49:27,000
it was never written by us also that

5368
03:49:27,000 --> 03:49:29,800
this year we'll do that many correct so

5369
03:49:29,800 --> 03:49:31,560
uh so how did you handle that stress of

5370
03:49:31,560 --> 03:49:34,399
having a billion dollar plus money into

5371
03:49:34,399 --> 03:49:36,319
the system someone's money right and

5372
03:49:36,319 --> 03:49:40,159
aaral Mar you know it

5373
03:49:40,159 --> 03:49:42,479
for the 20y old guy what's that weight

5374
03:49:42,479 --> 03:49:44,199
on that shoulder I mean I can't

5375
03:49:44,199 --> 03:49:49,000
even hold that up look I think uh and uh

5376
03:49:49,000 --> 03:49:51,319
plus accountability because once people

5377
03:49:51,319 --> 03:49:53,000
invest the capital then they require the

5378
03:49:53,000 --> 03:49:55,080
monthly update the regular reviews you

5379
03:49:55,080 --> 03:49:58,319
have any questions that can come up I

5380
03:49:58,319 --> 03:50:01,439
think fundamentally for me uh in the

5381
03:50:01,439 --> 03:50:04,640
early days especially the capital was

5382
03:50:04,640 --> 03:50:07,399
not a choice because I had no

5383
03:50:07,399 --> 03:50:11,239
resources to initi

5384
03:50:11,920 --> 03:50:13,760
I think India leadership sort of

5385
03:50:13,760 --> 03:50:15,800
happened

5386
03:50:15,800 --> 03:50:19,080
organically Global expansion that was in

5387
03:50:19,080 --> 03:50:21,920
my view driven by my own personal belief

5388
03:50:21,920 --> 03:50:24,880
in Impact like like what drives me every

5389
03:50:24,880 --> 03:50:27,800
day AK complex problems how many

5390
03:50:27,800 --> 03:50:30,120
people's lives I'm touching that

5391
03:50:30,120 --> 03:50:32,319
fundamentally I believe that that makes

5392
03:50:32,319 --> 03:50:34,560
a positive difference and good news is

5393
03:50:34,560 --> 03:50:36,040
that also commercially has a positive

5394
03:50:36,040 --> 03:50:37,439
impact because the more number of people

5395
03:50:37,439 --> 03:50:40,680
you are basically impacted in allows you

5396
03:50:40,680 --> 03:50:41,960
to be able to hopefully make some

5397
03:50:41,960 --> 03:50:43,520
additional outcome but it came with

5398
03:50:43,520 --> 03:50:44,880
challenges and there were mistakes made

5399
03:50:44,880 --> 03:50:47,640
I have no qualms about saying it so I

5400
03:50:47,640 --> 03:50:52,359
started fixing and consolidating 2020

5401
03:50:52,359 --> 03:50:55,120
early you think admitting mistakes

5402
03:50:55,120 --> 03:50:58,800
early sorry admitting mistakes early big

5403
03:50:58,800 --> 03:51:01,439
part of being successful I think so I

5404
03:51:01,439 --> 03:51:04,120
think admitting mistakes and saying Mia

5405
03:51:04,120 --> 03:51:07,080
kalpa is critical because a lot of

5406
03:51:07,080 --> 03:51:10,920
times early early yes uh the reason is

5407
03:51:10,920 --> 03:51:13,159
you know when you're having a you know

5408
03:51:13,159 --> 03:51:15,479
you effectively as a business leader or

5409
03:51:15,479 --> 03:51:17,040
an

5410
03:51:17,040 --> 03:51:20,800
entrepreneur you have to be able to make

5411
03:51:20,800 --> 03:51:23,040
decisions to make decisions it's

5412
03:51:23,040 --> 03:51:25,279
critical to have conversations which are

5413
03:51:25,279 --> 03:51:27,120
authentic and not

5414
03:51:27,120 --> 03:51:29,800
pretentious the only way you can have a

5415
03:51:29,800 --> 03:51:31,920
non-pretentious conversation is if the

5416
03:51:31,920 --> 03:51:36,560
elephant is uh uh out of the room if

5417
03:51:36,560 --> 03:51:38,760
people don't talk about elephant then

5418
03:51:38,760 --> 03:51:41,159
you can have

5419
03:51:46,720 --> 03:51:48,640
many but if you're able to say that

5420
03:51:48,640 --> 03:51:49,800
these are the mistakes that were made

5421
03:51:49,800 --> 03:51:51,760
and you have to be honest about it

5422
03:51:51,760 --> 03:51:57,120
because it is very um easy to understand

5423
03:51:57,399 --> 03:51:59,960
because

5424
03:51:59,960 --> 03:52:01,800
difference you can see it right like

5425
03:52:01,800 --> 03:52:03,640
because you can just come out of this

5426
03:52:03,640 --> 03:52:05,760
like you can go to indran nagar see a oo

5427
03:52:05,760 --> 03:52:09,359
hotel and say like see traces of what I

5428
03:52:09,359 --> 03:52:11,640
have said there and the other way around

5429
03:52:11,640 --> 03:52:13,840
in some context right or it's true for

5430
03:52:13,840 --> 03:52:15,920
all of our businesses that if mistakes

5431
03:52:15,920 --> 03:52:17,359
are made it will be visible at our this

5432
03:52:17,359 --> 03:52:19,319
is also very true for all successful

5433
03:52:19,319 --> 03:52:21,439
businesses because I see a lot of

5434
03:52:21,439 --> 03:52:24,319
Founders Not Having the courage to admit

5435
03:52:24,319 --> 03:52:26,920
that they've made a mistake and what

5436
03:52:26,920 --> 03:52:29,040
happens is they try and continue to

5437
03:52:29,040 --> 03:52:30,880
conceal it because they've pitched it in

5438
03:52:30,880 --> 03:52:33,359
a certain way they feel that the word is

5439
03:52:33,359 --> 03:52:35,319
so strong it becomes an ego problem and

5440
03:52:35,319 --> 03:52:39,359
they don't want to one admit it and

5441
03:52:39,359 --> 03:52:42,520
because of that they fall into that Loop

5442
03:52:42,520 --> 03:52:45,000
where you're not correcting the only way

5443
03:52:45,000 --> 03:52:47,479
to figure more lonely as an outcome

5444
03:52:47,479 --> 03:52:48,800
because more and more people sort of

5445
03:52:48,800 --> 03:52:51,040
desert you so I believe that admitting

5446
03:52:51,040 --> 03:52:53,560
mistake early is crucial and it is also

5447
03:52:53,560 --> 03:52:55,479
crucial to make sure that you are close

5448
03:52:55,479 --> 03:52:58,560
to your roots I think if you're uh when

5449
03:52:58,560 --> 03:53:01,399
you try to run away from mistakes it's a

5450
03:53:01,399 --> 03:53:05,000
very easy way of running away from

5451
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:07,080
reality and then you sort of build a

5452
03:53:07,080 --> 03:53:09,120
world around yourself which is just

5453
03:53:09,120 --> 03:53:10,960
entire but anyway I think long story

5454
03:53:10,960 --> 03:53:13,840
short I think mistakes are made I was

5455
03:53:13,840 --> 03:53:17,000
consolidating by the time I could fix it

5456
03:53:17,000 --> 03:53:19,720
Mr Co knocked in the door on the doors

5457
03:53:19,720 --> 03:53:22,319
and said well uh you know we'll do it

5458
03:53:22,319 --> 03:53:26,000
faster right I'll make it harder for you

5459
03:53:26,000 --> 03:53:29,120
so imagine I had forward invested that

5460
03:53:29,120 --> 03:53:30,840
we will we will the year before c we

5461
03:53:30,840 --> 03:53:32,359
grew

5462
03:53:32,359 --> 03:53:33,960
300%

5463
03:53:33,960 --> 03:53:36,760
right covid hits so you had forward

5464
03:53:36,760 --> 03:53:38,399
invested for growth you're starting to

5465
03:53:38,399 --> 03:53:39,920
consolidate

5466
03:53:39,920 --> 03:53:41,600
but you're able to fund it partly

5467
03:53:41,600 --> 03:53:42,760
through the margins you're generating

5468
03:53:42,760 --> 03:53:45,080
from the current revenues right and

5469
03:53:45,080 --> 03:53:46,840
partly through external

5470
03:53:46,840 --> 03:53:49,640
financing with Cod 65% of your Revenue

5471
03:53:49,640 --> 03:53:51,800
overnight

5472
03:53:51,800 --> 03:53:54,760
evaporate right so in effect you have to

5473
03:53:54,760 --> 03:53:57,960
fund 100% or majority through external

5474
03:53:57,960 --> 03:53:59,760
financing there is a limit to the

5475
03:53:59,760 --> 03:54:01,159
capital available there's not infinite

5476
03:54:01,159 --> 03:54:03,800
Capital available with anyone especially

5477
03:54:03,800 --> 03:54:05,920
for a business that is shrinking a

5478
03:54:05,920 --> 03:54:07,520
business that is growing higher slower

5479
03:54:07,520 --> 03:54:09,319
you can debate but a business was shrunk

5480
03:54:09,319 --> 03:54:12,120
during covid so it was hard on us most

5481
03:54:12,120 --> 03:54:16,120
digital lead Brands right e-commerce

5482
03:54:16,120 --> 03:54:18,560
gaming industry they they all saw

5483
03:54:18,560 --> 03:54:20,279
massive ramp up during

5484
03:54:20,279 --> 03:54:24,439
covid now not travel here I am not where

5485
03:54:24,439 --> 03:54:28,560
my revenue is shrink 65% M and people

5486
03:54:28,560 --> 03:54:30,640
were basically calling right all the

5487
03:54:30,640 --> 03:54:33,640
entire deck right from my cxus to the

5488
03:54:33,640 --> 03:54:37,920
last person recruiters calling saying

5489
03:54:37,920 --> 03:54:40,880
stock

5490
03:54:42,040 --> 03:54:45,319
here's two or 3x salary

5491
03:54:45,319 --> 03:54:47,359
jump and these were other travel

5492
03:54:47,359 --> 03:54:49,640
companies no no our people are not

5493
03:54:49,640 --> 03:54:50,760
Specialists right our people are

5494
03:54:50,760 --> 03:54:52,319
technology people so you basically can

5495
03:54:52,319 --> 03:54:54,520
recruit them across mostly generalists

5496
03:54:54,520 --> 03:54:56,479
right in terms of construct so the

5497
03:54:56,479 --> 03:54:59,040
fungibility of talent is very high with

5498
03:54:59,040 --> 03:55:03,479
other tech companies so salary

5499
03:55:03,479 --> 03:55:06,640
stock lifestyle be

5500
03:55:06,640 --> 03:55:08,479
better you know things will be much

5501
03:55:08,479 --> 03:55:10,399
better an outcome so I think

5502
03:55:10,399 --> 03:55:12,199
fundamentally at that point of time I

5503
03:55:12,199 --> 03:55:15,600
feel like that one year was probably one

5504
03:55:15,600 --> 03:55:17,520
of the toughest ones as an operator to

5505
03:55:17,520 --> 03:55:19,760
drive but I think at the same time I

5506
03:55:19,760 --> 03:55:21,120
feel like that one year really

5507
03:55:21,120 --> 03:55:22,680
transformed our company as well as as

5508
03:55:22,680 --> 03:55:24,159
the way we think and operate I think now

5509
03:55:24,159 --> 03:55:26,680
we become very comfortable being a 30%

5510
03:55:26,680 --> 03:55:28,399
Growth

5511
03:55:28,399 --> 03:55:31,319
Company we are happy about it I think we

5512
03:55:31,319 --> 03:55:33,120
have a sense of semblance on what we

5513
03:55:33,120 --> 03:55:35,279
believe is our cash flow margins and for

5514
03:55:35,279 --> 03:55:38,080
us I think we have a consumer rating

5515
03:55:38,080 --> 03:55:40,479
expectation below which we will not grow

5516
03:55:40,479 --> 03:55:42,960
we have a merchant Revenue expectation

5517
03:55:42,960 --> 03:55:44,279
below which will not grow and we have a

5518
03:55:44,279 --> 03:55:45,920
margin expectation at the Eid and cash

5519
03:55:45,920 --> 03:55:46,840
flow

5520
03:55:46,840 --> 03:55:49,720
level want to grow as quickly as we can

5521
03:55:49,720 --> 03:55:51,800
we will not gr I think a lot of these

5522
03:55:51,800 --> 03:55:53,120
perspectives I think would have come

5523
03:55:53,120 --> 03:55:55,120
anywh over time but I think Co

5524
03:55:55,120 --> 03:55:56,760
accelerated that significantly without

5525
03:55:56,760 --> 03:55:58,960
giving a choice I think I think what

5526
03:55:58,960 --> 03:56:03,080
you're also saying is a big determinant

5527
03:56:03,080 --> 03:56:03,920
of

5528
03:56:03,920 --> 03:56:07,279
success is the ability to get punched

5529
03:56:07,279 --> 03:56:09,600
not necessarily punched

5530
03:56:09,600 --> 03:56:11,960
yeah and be sanguin about it and go

5531
03:56:11,960 --> 03:56:16,120
about yeah life yeah big precursor to

5532
03:56:16,120 --> 03:56:19,560
success right but I think any startup

5533
03:56:19,560 --> 03:56:21,479
Journey you got to like be okay to get

5534
03:56:21,479 --> 03:56:23,840
beat up yeah yeah you will definitely

5535
03:56:23,840 --> 03:56:26,239
get beaten up how fast are you able to

5536
03:56:26,239 --> 03:56:28,159
bounce back I think that's that's and

5537
03:56:28,159 --> 03:56:31,439
you don't kind of like react or yeah

5538
03:56:31,439 --> 03:56:33,720
yeah like you would have uh I've never

5539
03:56:33,720 --> 03:56:35,760
seen you like speak back on social media

5540
03:56:35,760 --> 03:56:38,199
or defend yourself in a weird manner in

5541
03:56:38,199 --> 03:56:41,960
a defense ensive manner right no I think

5542
03:56:41,960 --> 03:56:44,720
personally I think I have uh learned to

5543
03:56:44,720 --> 03:56:47,000
take criticism in a very like and I

5544
03:56:47,000 --> 03:56:48,319
believe it will be very valuable for

5545
03:56:48,319 --> 03:56:50,760
other young people listening

5546
03:56:50,760 --> 03:56:53,359
also like if if I read some of the

5547
03:56:53,359 --> 03:56:54,800
Business Leaders some people say that I

5548
03:56:54,800 --> 03:56:56,880
don't read news about us actually I'm

5549
03:56:56,880 --> 03:56:58,720
quite the contrary I read

5550
03:56:58,720 --> 03:57:00,760
everything I have no problem reading

5551
03:57:00,760 --> 03:57:03,319
everything but I can read everything and

5552
03:57:03,319 --> 03:57:05,960
feel comfortable

5553
03:57:05,960 --> 03:57:09,399
that so I think fundamentally criticism

5554
03:57:09,399 --> 03:57:11,279
can be constructive or it can be just

5555
03:57:11,279 --> 03:57:13,560
noise noise never sticks because Noise

5556
03:57:13,560 --> 03:57:14,600
by

5557
03:57:14,600 --> 03:57:16,880
design that I'm reading about myself

5558
03:57:16,880 --> 03:57:20,359
that I don't know about right like

5559
03:57:20,359 --> 03:57:22,880
there'd be some news of saying that AA

5560
03:57:22,880 --> 03:57:25,880
uh oo is buying some business in

5561
03:57:25,880 --> 03:57:27,840
Southeast Asia or some business in

5562
03:57:27,840 --> 03:57:30,880
Middle East I know there's no such to it

5563
03:57:30,880 --> 03:57:32,159
to some people

5564
03:57:32,159 --> 03:57:34,239
speculate it's done or something will

5565
03:57:34,239 --> 03:57:37,800
come about well U you knowes is going to

5566
03:57:37,800 --> 03:57:40,319
do something new very soon so I feel

5567
03:57:40,319 --> 03:57:41,920
like it's some noise it will not stick

5568
03:57:41,920 --> 03:57:43,800
what is your relationship with masayoshi

5569
03:57:43,800 --> 03:57:46,930
son how did it get inculcated has it

5570
03:57:46,930 --> 03:57:48,199
[Music]

5571
03:57:48,199 --> 03:57:53,439
SED look I think uh you asked who I you

5572
03:57:53,439 --> 03:57:55,960
know I often call him sonan given in

5573
03:57:55,960 --> 03:57:58,920
Japan you typically add a son at the end

5574
03:57:58,920 --> 03:58:03,040
um out of respect so I think sonan um is

5575
03:58:03,040 --> 03:58:04,479
first generation

5576
03:58:04,479 --> 03:58:07,840
entrepreneur um invested in Alibaba

5577
03:58:07,840 --> 03:58:09,680
quite early but his own Telecom business

5578
03:58:09,680 --> 03:58:11,760
which is now probably the most

5579
03:58:11,760 --> 03:58:13,560
profitable business in Japan and one of

5580
03:58:13,560 --> 03:58:15,120
the most profitable Telecom business in

5581
03:58:15,120 --> 03:58:17,399
the world uh in terms of

5582
03:58:17,399 --> 03:58:20,080
construct uh and then invested in alib

5583
03:58:20,080 --> 03:58:21,720
Baba which did very well and then set up

5584
03:58:21,720 --> 03:58:23,319
multiple software Eng Vision funds and

5585
03:58:23,319 --> 03:58:25,720
arm and few others I think so that's the

5586
03:58:25,720 --> 03:58:29,000
context behind who he is I think

5587
03:58:29,000 --> 03:58:32,239
um I would basically correlate it as

5588
03:58:32,239 --> 03:58:34,239
soft bank's relationship and within that

5589
03:58:34,239 --> 03:58:37,720
of course talk about sunsan I think I

5590
03:58:37,720 --> 03:58:40,439
got introduced to soft bank first time

5591
03:58:40,439 --> 03:58:43,359
in 2015 or 2016 right when we were in

5592
03:58:43,359 --> 03:58:45,120
that growth phase we in three cities

5593
03:58:45,120 --> 03:58:47,760
then just starting to take

5594
03:58:47,760 --> 03:58:51,520
off so uh I think Nikes introduced us

5595
03:58:51,520 --> 03:58:53,720
and Nikes did the work he's now the CEO

5596
03:58:53,720 --> 03:58:56,479
of PA Alto networks the deal was more or

5597
03:58:56,479 --> 03:58:58,319
less agreed between Nik and the broader

5598
03:58:58,319 --> 03:58:59,800
soft Bank team there was a broader soft

5599
03:58:59,800 --> 03:59:01,880
bank and soft Bank team uh at that time

5600
03:59:01,880 --> 03:59:02,880
they used to invest from the balance

5601
03:59:02,880 --> 03:59:05,680
sheet so that's how we uh got introduced

5602
03:59:05,680 --> 03:59:07,840
to each other in the first place so

5603
03:59:07,840 --> 03:59:09,600
before the fin investment decision is

5604
03:59:09,600 --> 03:59:12,560
made is you have to go and present to

5605
03:59:12,560 --> 03:59:15,760
sonan and he approves finally so I went

5606
03:59:15,760 --> 03:59:18,399
to Japan I was again very excited to go

5607
03:59:18,399 --> 03:59:20,279
to a new country I'm so I'm generally

5608
03:59:20,279 --> 03:59:22,920
the person who's always very happy and

5609
03:59:22,920 --> 03:59:24,880
excited about new places and new things

5610
03:59:24,880 --> 03:59:26,680
right like you know now the Shar Tang

5611
03:59:26,680 --> 03:59:28,880
episodes are airing so there's some

5612
03:59:28,880 --> 03:59:30,159
trolls saying that you know why are you

5613
03:59:30,159 --> 03:59:32,359
smiling all the time I'm just generally

5614
03:59:32,359 --> 03:59:34,920
happy being

5615
03:59:34,920 --> 03:59:37,560
there you're smiling even today that's

5616
03:59:37,560 --> 03:59:40,279
that's who you are so I'm generally like

5617
03:59:40,279 --> 03:59:41,960
you know whenever I'm in new places I'm

5618
03:59:41,960 --> 03:59:45,520
happy I'm excited

5619
03:59:45,520 --> 03:59:48,600
so sonan comes I make a quick

5620
03:59:48,600 --> 03:59:51,040
presentation so he explains two or three

5621
03:59:51,040 --> 03:59:52,479
things which is quite fascinating to me

5622
03:59:52,479 --> 03:59:54,760
I think first thing he mentions is that

5623
03:59:54,760 --> 03:59:57,279
if I were you I would go as full stack

5624
03:59:57,279 --> 03:59:58,960
as possible rather than being more and

5625
03:59:58,960 --> 04:00:01,120
more Marketplace which is that I do more

5626
04:00:01,120 --> 04:00:04,040
to control the experience um do you mean

5627
04:00:04,040 --> 04:00:06,239
own the hotel no not own the hotel but

5628
04:00:06,239 --> 04:00:08,399
basically sort of can you potenti

5629
04:00:08,399 --> 04:00:11,640
actually like delivery companies have a

5630
04:00:11,640 --> 04:00:13,760
service provider goes and delivers can

5631
04:00:13,760 --> 04:00:16,120
the front office manager be yours right

5632
04:00:16,120 --> 04:00:17,960
so that uh you can have slightly greater

5633
04:00:17,960 --> 04:00:19,600
control over the experience of course

5634
04:00:19,600 --> 04:00:21,439
the are economics of it which can be

5635
04:00:21,439 --> 04:00:23,840
complicated the second uh or or

5636
04:00:23,840 --> 04:00:26,080
beneficial depends second thing he says

5637
04:00:26,080 --> 04:00:30,279
is you're very early uh but I think um

5638
04:00:30,279 --> 04:00:32,880
you know if you are in this growth path

5639
04:00:32,880 --> 04:00:35,120
making sure that you continuously track

5640
04:00:35,120 --> 04:00:38,840
the consumer satisfaction Loop closure M

5641
04:00:38,840 --> 04:00:40,800
will be crucial before you ramp up or

5642
04:00:40,800 --> 04:00:42,720
down there will be times when the

5643
04:00:42,720 --> 04:00:44,159
consumer feedbacks will continue to be

5644
04:00:44,159 --> 04:00:45,840
positive and he said it will most

5645
04:00:45,840 --> 04:00:47,479
definitely happen and did happen to us

5646
04:00:47,479 --> 04:00:49,840
that the feedbacks will be great all all

5647
04:00:49,840 --> 04:00:50,800
through when you're growing and then

5648
04:00:50,800 --> 04:00:52,239
suddenly one day you'll see that you've

5649
04:00:52,239 --> 04:00:54,239
grown greater than usual the consumer

5650
04:00:54,239 --> 04:00:55,840
feedback is not showing that great

5651
04:00:55,840 --> 04:00:58,279
outcomes he said that will necessarily

5652
04:00:58,279 --> 04:00:59,760
happen when it does happen you should

5653
04:00:59,760 --> 04:01:02,000
consider pausing and the third he said

5654
04:01:02,000 --> 04:01:04,120
is that you are the CEO so you make the

5655
04:01:04,120 --> 04:01:06,680
decisions um you'll receive great ideas

5656
04:01:06,680 --> 04:01:10,439
from all our uh advisers but eventually

5657
04:01:10,439 --> 04:01:12,560
if your company does well or not You' be

5658
04:01:12,560 --> 04:01:14,560
responsible all three made complete

5659
04:01:14,560 --> 04:01:16,760
sense but you only appreciate like he

5660
04:01:16,760 --> 04:01:18,840
said tution fees you only appreciate

5661
04:01:18,840 --> 04:01:20,640
when you made enough mistakes you don't

5662
04:01:20,640 --> 04:01:22,520
listen or appreciate those just purely

5663
04:01:22,520 --> 04:01:25,439
by words very wise words though so

5664
04:01:25,439 --> 04:01:26,560
that's how the investment happened with

5665
04:01:26,560 --> 04:01:27,520
soft

5666
04:01:27,520 --> 04:01:31,800
Bank um and then of course the very

5667
04:01:31,800 --> 04:01:34,040
quickly nikesh moved on and I think ever

5668
04:01:34,040 --> 04:01:37,279
since after that Rajiv munish and that

5669
04:01:37,279 --> 04:01:39,399
sort of cohort uh became our primary

5670
04:01:39,399 --> 04:01:41,560
Partners from uh from soft Bank over the

5671
04:01:41,560 --> 04:01:44,199
years and our relationship was very much

5672
04:01:44,199 --> 04:01:46,520
you know we meet in a quarter review the

5673
04:01:46,520 --> 04:01:49,840
business go through and once in a year

5674
04:01:49,840 --> 04:01:51,279
uh you know you also get invited to go

5675
04:01:51,279 --> 04:01:54,520
present to sonan and I think the one

5676
04:01:54,520 --> 04:01:56,399
unique takeaway that I have personally

5677
04:01:56,399 --> 04:01:57,880
about sonan that I think most of the

5678
04:01:57,880 --> 04:02:00,279
people have not talked about is people

5679
04:02:00,279 --> 04:02:03,520
see sonan primarily as an investor right

5680
04:02:03,520 --> 04:02:08,239
Financial investor and so on I think

5681
04:02:08,239 --> 04:02:10,680
he's at his heart an entrepreneur first

5682
04:02:10,680 --> 04:02:14,399
and an investor second M and the depth

5683
04:02:14,399 --> 04:02:17,000
and the attention to detail that he has

5684
04:02:17,000 --> 04:02:19,720
his creativity and his sense of sort of

5685
04:02:19,720 --> 04:02:22,479
um coming up with new ideas are in my

5686
04:02:22,479 --> 04:02:25,199
view what makes him special in the first

5687
04:02:25,199 --> 04:02:26,720
place

5688
04:02:26,720 --> 04:02:30,000
insane insane curiously curious ability

5689
04:02:30,000 --> 04:02:32,040
curious without an ego that's a good way

5690
04:02:32,040 --> 04:02:34,479
to put it you've given me so much I'm

5691
04:02:34,479 --> 04:02:37,359
I'll tell you from my side I learned so

5692
04:02:37,359 --> 04:02:40,359
much from you guys right uh in so many

5693
04:02:40,359 --> 04:02:42,920
different facets some that are evident

5694
04:02:42,920 --> 04:02:44,760
some that are non-evident like the

5695
04:02:44,760 --> 04:02:46,520
father thing my father passed away like

5696
04:02:46,520 --> 04:02:49,560
just now 30 days 35 days ago so sorry to

5697
04:02:49,560 --> 04:02:53,080
hear no but your journey 1 month 3

5698
04:02:53,080 --> 04:02:55,159
months 6 months I was asking you six

5699
04:02:55,159 --> 04:02:57,880
years very interesting okay

5700
04:02:57,880 --> 04:03:02,920
so I'm going to put down success

5701
04:03:02,920 --> 04:03:06,600
parameters add to the previous two and

5702
04:03:06,600 --> 04:03:11,680
say admitting mistakes early very

5703
04:03:12,000 --> 04:03:13,560
important

5704
04:03:13,560 --> 04:03:16,279
curiosity extremely extremely important

5705
04:03:16,279 --> 04:03:19,399
probably something I resonate with the

5706
04:03:19,399 --> 04:03:24,120
most contrarian very nature of a startup

5707
04:03:24,120 --> 04:03:25,640
I think a company

5708
04:03:25,640 --> 04:03:28,680
begins with something contrarian

5709
04:03:28,680 --> 04:03:31,159
especially if you're starting young

5710
04:03:31,159 --> 04:03:34,120
Clarity of thought rigid particular all

5711
04:03:34,120 --> 04:03:35,800
three of you said

5712
04:03:35,800 --> 04:03:39,920
that with you Nuance I I would add in a

5713
04:03:39,920 --> 04:03:42,199
very toist

5714
04:03:42,199 --> 04:03:45,399
way likability and niceness is so

5715
04:03:45,399 --> 04:03:48,560
underrated in the world right now like a

5716
04:03:48,560 --> 04:03:51,520
lot of people I choose to work with I

5717
04:03:51,520 --> 04:03:54,159
choose to partner with I

5718
04:03:54,159 --> 04:03:56,640
think today I have the privilege and

5719
04:03:56,640 --> 04:03:58,800
it's also such an important metric to me

5720
04:03:58,800 --> 04:04:00,439
that I need to like hanging out with

5721
04:04:00,439 --> 04:04:02,960
them at the core they need to be nice

5722
04:04:02,960 --> 04:04:05,439
people so I think people undermine the

5723
04:04:05,439 --> 04:04:07,640
importance of how likable and nice you

5724
04:04:07,640 --> 04:04:09,960
are as a person I think it's incredibly

5725
04:04:09,960 --> 04:04:11,439
valuable as a

5726
04:04:11,439 --> 04:04:15,120
business all of you said again you with

5727
04:04:15,120 --> 04:04:17,479
standing outside guzzle stood outside a

5728
04:04:17,479 --> 04:04:20,840
toy store Manish was willing to bend his

5729
04:04:20,840 --> 04:04:23,399
back and go ask somebody something that

5730
04:04:23,399 --> 04:04:26,359
other people might not have no ego which

5731
04:04:26,359 --> 04:04:30,000
also came from you again incredible

5732
04:04:30,000 --> 04:04:31,840
always be selling even when they were

5733
04:04:31,840 --> 04:04:33,080
answering their questions you were

5734
04:04:33,080 --> 04:04:36,439
selling and plugging oo rooms I think

5735
04:04:36,439 --> 04:04:39,560
that again is incredibly important

5736
04:04:39,560 --> 04:04:42,880
uh delaying ratification indifference is

5737
04:04:42,880 --> 04:04:46,199
cool both of these again on top of the

5738
04:04:46,199 --> 04:04:48,920
list so what we're trying to like arrive

5739
04:04:48,920 --> 04:04:53,000
at today is whenever a young 21y old boy

5740
04:04:53,000 --> 04:04:56,319
or girl wants to know what makes startup

5741
04:04:56,319 --> 04:04:59,560
Founders people like yourself successful

5742
04:04:59,560 --> 04:05:03,239
they get generic they get hardw

5743
04:05:03,239 --> 04:05:07,000
workk they get sell in this particular

5744
04:05:07,000 --> 04:05:09,359
manner use the sales

5745
04:05:09,359 --> 04:05:12,080
strategy all of it which is taking away

5746
04:05:12,080 --> 04:05:14,880
from the core emotion of what is

5747
04:05:14,880 --> 04:05:18,000
actually working for you guys so intent

5748
04:05:18,000 --> 04:05:21,600
here was to ask you non-usual questions

5749
04:05:21,600 --> 04:05:24,640
get non-usual answers and hopefully help

5750
04:05:24,640 --> 04:05:27,479
that 21y old I'll run through all three

5751
04:05:27,479 --> 04:05:30,159
of your main things starting with yours

5752
04:05:30,159 --> 04:05:33,520
optimism aware of cyclicality continuing

5753
04:05:33,520 --> 04:05:36,199
from where we left off Serendipity is

5754
04:05:36,199 --> 04:05:39,439
again a very interesting one

5755
04:05:39,439 --> 04:05:43,080
right impostor complex is good a lot of

5756
04:05:43,080 --> 04:05:46,239
us seem to have it insecurity is good as

5757
04:05:46,239 --> 04:05:48,080
long as neither of these lead to

5758
04:05:48,080 --> 04:05:50,920
inaction but they lead to action right

5759
04:05:50,920 --> 04:05:53,159
yeah it can't that's very important it's

5760
04:05:53,159 --> 04:05:54,560
called good sense of

5761
04:05:54,560 --> 04:05:58,199
insecurity yeah yeah

5762
04:05:58,199 --> 04:06:00,359
creativity this is

5763
04:06:00,359 --> 04:06:03,640
again something that is often

5764
04:06:03,640 --> 04:06:06,560
overlooked you defined creativity in a

5765
04:06:06,560 --> 04:06:08,520
very nice manner

5766
04:06:08,520 --> 04:06:11,080
rewarding loyalty reprimanding

5767
04:06:11,080 --> 04:06:15,080
disloyalty very important true forgiving

5768
04:06:15,080 --> 04:06:18,040
but not forgetting yeah

5769
04:06:18,040 --> 04:06:22,840
confidence in how you look post 12 this

5770
04:06:22,840 --> 04:06:25,880
could come via playing a sport yoga

5771
04:06:25,880 --> 04:06:29,920
sleeping for 8 hours extremely important

5772
04:06:29,920 --> 04:06:32,080
cuz you confident about how you look and

5773
04:06:32,080 --> 04:06:34,880
how you feel about yourself you're

5774
04:06:34,880 --> 04:06:37,560
likely more easily confident about what

5775
04:06:37,560 --> 04:06:40,800
you're selling

5776
04:06:40,800 --> 04:06:43,520
Fair sleep holiday all of this comes

5777
04:06:43,520 --> 04:06:45,279
into the same

5778
04:06:45,279 --> 04:06:51,479
thing avoidant attachment type good for

5779
04:06:51,479 --> 04:06:55,040
startups bad for relationships overall

5780
04:06:55,040 --> 04:06:57,840
but good for starting a company I think

5781
04:06:57,840 --> 04:07:00,319
I'm like that like I have a

5782
04:07:00,319 --> 04:07:05,120
tendency I I fear sympathy in others

5783
04:07:05,120 --> 04:07:09,239
eyes for me I fear being vulnerable so

5784
04:07:09,239 --> 04:07:12,319
much that if I am going through

5785
04:07:12,319 --> 04:07:14,920
something I will hide it like something

5786
04:07:14,920 --> 04:07:17,520
bad happening in my life some bad event

5787
04:07:17,520 --> 04:07:20,080
I would rarely mention it yeah but

5788
04:07:20,080 --> 04:07:23,159
that's yeah it's bad but bad bad in

5789
04:07:23,159 --> 04:07:25,199
relationships very unhealthy but for a

5790
04:07:25,199 --> 04:07:27,600
company maybe it's to start a company I

5791
04:07:27,600 --> 04:07:29,640
don't know how that's translating but

5792
04:07:29,640 --> 04:07:33,520
that seems to be common to a lot of

5793
04:07:33,520 --> 04:07:36,279
people even even uh even with your

5794
04:07:36,279 --> 04:07:39,199
company is that is that that good it's

5795
04:07:39,199 --> 04:07:41,000
healthy if you're not emotionally

5796
04:07:41,000 --> 04:07:43,680
attached to the company no but when when

5797
04:07:43,680 --> 04:07:47,439
times get tough and I feel that I have

5798
04:07:47,439 --> 04:07:49,479
that emotional connect with my company

5799
04:07:49,479 --> 04:07:52,239
where I still I'll be like I will figure

5800
04:07:52,239 --> 04:07:54,040
this out but if I

5801
04:07:54,040 --> 04:07:56,880
am and for which I also end up being

5802
04:07:56,880 --> 04:07:58,840
vulnerable in front of my leadership

5803
04:07:58,840 --> 04:08:00,800
team being open about what's happening

5804
04:08:00,800 --> 04:08:02,520
and trying to figure it out all together

5805
04:08:02,520 --> 04:08:04,880
because I can't do it alone if I don't

5806
04:08:04,880 --> 04:08:07,880
have that I feel that how how do you

5807
04:08:07,880 --> 04:08:11,600
look at it actually very interesting

5808
04:08:12,000 --> 04:08:16,600
Nuance I feel like I get stoic about

5809
04:08:16,600 --> 04:08:18,880
things that are not working cuz I feel

5810
04:08:18,880 --> 04:08:21,640
like in life 10 things are not working

5811
04:08:21,640 --> 04:08:24,159
at the same time so I take that thing

5812
04:08:24,159 --> 04:08:26,399
which is not working and my avoidant

5813
04:08:26,399 --> 04:08:29,439
type puts it in a compartment and I come

5814
04:08:29,439 --> 04:08:31,520
back to it after I fix three four of the

5815
04:08:31,520 --> 04:08:33,119
10

5816
04:08:33,119 --> 04:08:35,720
things but for that second what works

5817
04:08:35,720 --> 04:08:38,279
for me is compartmentalizing it's very

5818
04:08:38,279 --> 04:08:41,319
like uh stoic

5819
04:08:41,319 --> 04:08:44,359
nihilistic in its

5820
04:08:44,359 --> 04:08:46,800
origin that seems to be a common trait

5821
04:08:46,800 --> 04:08:47,479
as

5822
04:08:47,479 --> 04:08:50,040
well and what made it even more

5823
04:08:50,040 --> 04:08:52,800
interesting is one is bootstrapped one

5824
04:08:52,800 --> 04:08:55,520
is a public company and one is a largely

5825
04:08:55,520 --> 04:08:58,439
funded company so we covered broad

5826
04:08:58,439 --> 04:09:01,359
spectrum what we think are the

5827
04:09:01,359 --> 04:09:05,159
prerequisites to be successful in a

5828
04:09:05,159 --> 04:09:07,279
startup I think Manish had something

5829
04:09:07,279 --> 04:09:10,800
else story very very important almost as

5830
04:09:10,800 --> 04:09:14,600
important as a product we your story

5831
04:09:14,600 --> 04:09:16,359
even if it is

5832
04:09:16,359 --> 04:09:19,080
embellished in the very beginning in a

5833
04:09:19,080 --> 04:09:21,720
manner that is most appealing to the

5834
04:09:21,720 --> 04:09:24,840
audience you're try trying to cater to

5835
04:09:24,840 --> 04:09:28,319
Fair pay attention to detail every

5836
04:09:28,319 --> 04:09:32,080
little detail perfume

5837
04:09:32,080 --> 04:09:35,000
music what else did you say the tiny

5838
04:09:35,000 --> 04:09:37,199
details the horizontal creative of the

5839
04:09:37,199 --> 04:09:39,000
perfume how it's going to come to life

5840
04:09:39,000 --> 04:09:42,040
not having the logo on the Indian V

5841
04:09:42,040 --> 04:09:44,520
sizes are 2 in higher than be rigid on

5842
04:09:44,520 --> 04:09:46,119
that as well yeah people are here to

5843
04:09:46,119 --> 04:09:47,560
change you

5844
04:09:47,560 --> 04:09:51,960
yeah another big big commonality between

5845
04:09:51,960 --> 04:09:53,800
everybody who's a successful

5846
04:09:53,800 --> 04:09:56,760
entrepreneur is take

5847
04:09:56,760 --> 04:10:01,119
risk risk taking ability seems to be one

5848
04:10:01,119 --> 04:10:03,399
par higher In This Crowd of successful

5849
04:10:03,399 --> 04:10:06,199
ones versus everybody else having 10

5850
04:10:06,199 --> 04:10:09,640
Crowes and taking a 37 cow loan leaving

5851
04:10:09,640 --> 04:10:11,560
home uh and

5852
04:10:11,560 --> 04:10:14,239
doing uh art which is the most

5853
04:10:14,239 --> 04:10:15,960
counterintuitive thing that anybody

5854
04:10:15,960 --> 04:10:18,359
would do Beyond a course in nit learning

5855
04:10:18,359 --> 04:10:22,040
to be a computer programming teacher

5856
04:10:22,040 --> 04:10:25,840
yeah multiple times uh going to New York

5857
04:10:25,840 --> 04:10:28,359
in your first year of marriage all by

5858
04:10:28,359 --> 04:10:30,760
myself all by yourself moved out of

5859
04:10:30,760 --> 04:10:32,960
chandigar the only other city was Delhi

5860
04:10:32,960 --> 04:10:35,000
yeah for Rees I can't even begin there's

5861
04:10:35,000 --> 04:10:39,199
so much like so much in terms of taking

5862
04:10:39,199 --> 04:10:43,080
risk outside of what a conformist

5863
04:10:43,080 --> 04:10:45,800
conventional normal 20-year-old boy of

5864
04:10:45,800 --> 04:10:48,199
your age would have done what this paper

5865
04:10:48,199 --> 04:10:50,840
misses out is once you incorporate or

5866
04:10:50,840 --> 04:10:54,319
try to inculcate some of this the

5867
04:10:54,319 --> 04:10:57,119
underlying differentiator between a and

5868
04:10:57,119 --> 04:11:00,040
b and c and d is luck at the very core

5869
04:11:00,040 --> 04:11:02,920
of it I think you have to come to term

5870
04:11:02,920 --> 04:11:04,800
every single entrepreneur has to come to

5871
04:11:04,800 --> 04:11:07,080
terms with that but you know what I feel

5872
04:11:07,080 --> 04:11:09,520
is the bigger challenge than going from

5873
04:11:09,520 --> 04:11:14,359
0er to one is finding the gumption in

5874
04:11:14,359 --> 04:11:18,080
you to reinvent yourself after the

5875
04:11:18,080 --> 04:11:20,359
ecosystem around you has built up your

5876
04:11:20,359 --> 04:11:23,880
ego into a bubble to come to terms with

5877
04:11:23,880 --> 04:11:25,560
the fact that you have become complacent

5878
04:11:25,560 --> 04:11:28,319
faster than the market tells you yeah

5879
04:11:28,319 --> 04:11:30,279
yeah I and that's how the incumbents

5880
04:11:30,279 --> 04:11:33,239
lead right yeah like Facebook's greatest

5881
04:11:33,239 --> 04:11:36,720
example is ditching the metav and then

5882

5883
04:11:38,560 --> 04:11:39,920

5888
04:11:47,560 --> 04:11:49,199
we should we add that surrounding

5889
04:11:49,199 --> 04:11:51,960
